22445702;pi001;On the origins of human handedness and language: A comparative review of hand preferences for bimanual coordinated actions and gestural communication in nonhuman primates;"Meguerditchian A; Vauclair J; Hopkins W D ";Journal Article;Within the evolutionary framework about the origin of human handedness and hemispheric specialization for language, the question of expression of population-level manual biases in nonhuman primates and their potential continuities with humans remains controversial. Nevertheless, there is a growing body of evidence showing consistent population-level handedness particularly for complex manual behaviors in both monkeys and apes. In the present article, within a large comparative approach among primates, we will review our contribution to the field and the handedness literature related to two particular sophisticated manual behaviors regarding their potential and specific implications for the origins of hemispheric specialization in humans: bimanual coordinated actions and gestural communication. Whereas bimanual coordinated actions seem to elicit predominance of left-handedness in arboreal primates and of right-handedness in terrestrial primates, all handedness studies that have investigated gestural communication in several primate species have reported stronger degree of population-level right-handedness compared to noncommunicative actions. Communicative gestures and bimanual actions seem to affect differently manual asymmetries in both human and nonhuman primates and to be related to different lateralized brain substrates. We will discuss (1) how the data of hand preferences for bimanual coordinated actions highlight the role of ecological factors in the evolution of handedness and provide additional support the postural origin theory of handedness proposed by MacNeilage [MacNeilage [2007]. Present status of the postural origins theory. In W. D. Hopkins (Ed.), The evolution of hemispheric specialization in primates (pp. 59�91).

22445215;pi002;A word in the hand: The gestural origins of language;Corballis M C ;Book Chapter;The evolution of language, it has been suggested, may be 'the hardest problem in science'. In 1866, shortly after the publication of Darwin's (1859) Origin of Species, it was so controversial that the Linguistics Society of Paris banned all discussion of the origins of language, and shortly afterwards the Philological Society of London followed suit. This seemed to create something of a hiatus, and it was not really until around a century later that interest picked up again. Even so, the topic remains highly contentious to the point that one might wonder whether the ban should be reinstated. One widely held theory is that held by the dominant linguist of our time, Noam Chomsky, and supported by a number of archeologists and prehistorians. This theory might be termed the 'big bang' theory, since it holds that language emerged in a single step and was restricted to our own species, Homo sapiens. In evolutionary terms this theory effectively denies any evolutionary precursors and is nonspecific as to the mechanisms of evolutionary change. In this chapter, the author discusses this theory first, and suggest that it is deeply implausible, then go on to consider an evolutionary account that is in many respects its opposite. In this alternative view language evolved from manual gestures, and its origins go far back in primate evolution.

22445083;pi003;Gestural and symbolic development among apes and humans: Support for a multimodal theory of language evolution;"Gillespie-Lynch K; Greenfield P M; Lyn H; Savage-Rumbaugh S ";Journal Article;What are the implications of similarities and differences in the gestural and symbolic development of apes and humans? This focused review uses as a starting point our recent study that provided evidence that gesture supported the symbolic development of a chimpanzee, a bonobo, and a human child reared in language-enriched environments at comparable stages of communicative development. These three species constitute a complete clade, species possessing a common immediate ancestor. Communicative behaviors observed among all species in a clade are likely to have been present in the common ancestor. Similarities in the form and function of many gestures produced by the chimpanzee, bonobo, and human child suggest that shared non-verbal skills may underlie shared symbolic capacities. Indeed, an ontogenetic sequence from gesture to symbol was present across the clade but more pronounced in child than ape. Multimodal expressions of communicative intent (e.g., vocalization plus persistence or eye-contact) were normative for the child, but less common for the apes. These findings suggest that increasing multimodal expression of communicative intent may have supported the emergence of language among the ancestors of humans. Therefore, this focused review includes new studies, since our 2013 article, that support a multimodal theory of language evolution.

22445425;pi005;Vocal and gestural communication in nonhuman primates and the question of the origin of language;"Meguerditchian A; Vauclair J";Book Chapter;"Human language is an extraordinary and unique means of communication, which involves complex cognitive functions like intentionality, generativity, elaboration, and comprehension of syntax, empathy, imitation, invention and manipulation of symbols, conceptual representations, categorization, referential cues, etc. In investigating the question of language origin, linguists often discount the views of primatologists, even though they have important contributions to make to the multidisciplinary effort necessary to deal with language evolution (Christiansen & Kirby, 2003; Hauser et al., 2002). Since nonhuman primates are phylogenetically very close to humans, research on our cousins can provide essential clues for inferring the features of our ancestral communication systems. Thus, a prime question for primatologists is to investigate whether direct precursors of language in the communicative behaviours of nonhuman primates. In this chapter we review several major studies in nonhuman primates that possibly provide evidence for the main precursors of linguistic properties that are shared by both the gestural and the vocal modalities. These properties comprise flexibility of learning and use, intentional control and referential communication. Features associated exclusively with vocal articulated language will not be considered, e.g., the anatomy of the vocal apparatus, the acoustical traits of vocal signals, or the mechanisms of speech production and articulation. However, we will consider the neural substrate of gestural and vocal communication in nonhuman primates and examine the evidence for precursors of a left-hemispheric lateralization, which is typically involved in the control of speech. We will also discuss several studies on cognition, communication systems, and communicative behaviours in monkeys and apes in order to compare the main arguments for the gestural and the vocal theories of language origin.

22445607;pi006;Visible movements of the orofacial area: Evidence for gestural or multimodal theories of language evolution?;"Wacewicz S; Zywiczynski P; Orzechowski S";Journal Article;The age-old debate between the proponents of the gesture-first and speech-first positions has returned to occupy a central place in current language evolution theorizing. The gestural scenarios, suffering from the problem known as 'modality transition' (why a gestural system would have changed into a predominantly spoken system), frequently appeal to the gestures of the orofacial area as a platform for this putative transition. Here, we review currently available evidence on the significance of the orofacial area in language evolution. While our review offers some support for orofacial movements as an evolutionary 'bridge' between manual gesture and speech, we see the evidence as far more consistent with a multimodal approach. We also suggest that, more generally, the 'gestural versus spoken' formulation is limiting and would be better expressed in terms of the relative input and interplay of the visual and vocal-auditory sensory modalities.

22444935;pi007;Young children spontaneously recreate core properties of language in a new modality;"Bohn M; Kachel G; Tomasello M";Journal Article;"How the world's 6,000+ natural languages have arisen is mostly unknown. Yet, new sign languages have emerged recently among deaf people brought together in a community, offering insights into the dynamics of language evolution. However, documenting the emergence of these languages has mostly consisted of studying the end product; the process by which ad hoc signs are transformed into a structured communication system has not been directly observed. Here we show how young children create new communication systems that exhibit core features of natural languages in less than 30 min. In a controlled setting, we blocked the possibility of using spoken language. In order to communicate novel messages, including abstract concepts, dyads of children spontaneously created novel gestural signs. Over usage, these signs became increasingly arbitrary and conventionalized. When confronted with the need to communicate more complex meanings, children began to grammatically structure their gestures. Together with previous work, these results suggest that children have the basic skills necessary, not only to acquire a natural language, but also to spontaneously create a new one. The speed with which children create these structured systems has profound implications for theorizing about language evolution, a process which is generally thought to span across many generations, if not millennia.

22445124;pi009;A cross-species study of gesture and its role in symbolic development: Implications for the gestural theory of language evolution;"Gillespie-Lynch K; Greenfield P M; Feng Y; Savage-Rumbaugh S; Lyn H";Journal Article;"Using a naturalistic video database, we examined whether gestures scaffold the symbolic development of a language-enculturated chimpanzee, a language-enculturated bonobo, and a human child during the second year of life. These three species constitute a complete clade: species possessing a common immediate ancestor. A basic finding was the functional and formal similarity of many gestures between chimpanzee, bonobo, and human child. The child�s symbols were spoken words; the apes� symbols were lexigrams�noniconic visual signifiers. A developmental pattern in which gestural representation of a referent preceded symbolic representation of the same referent appeared in all three species (but was statistically significant only for the child). Nonetheless, across species, the ratio of symbol to gesture increased significantly with age. But even though their symbol production increased, the apes continued to communicate more frequently by gesture than by symbol. In contrast, by 15�18 months of age, the child used symbols more frequently than gestures. This ontogenetic sequence from gesture to symbol, present across the clade but more pronounced in child than ape, provides support for the role of gesture in language evolution. In all three species, the overwhelming majority of gestures were communicative (i.e., paired with eye contact, vocalization, and/or persistence). However, vocalization was rare for the apes, but accompanied the majority of the child�s communicative gestures. This species difference suggests the co-evolution of speech and gesture after the evolutionary divergence of the hominid line. Multimodal expressions of communicative intent (e.g., vocalization plus persistence) were normative for the child, but less common for the apes. This species difference suggests that multimodal expression of communicative intent was also strengthened after hominids diverged from apes.

22445346;pi011;Mirror neurons, gestures and language evolution;"Fogassi L; Ferrari P F";Journal Article;Different theories have been proposed for explaining the evolution of language. One of this maintains that gestural communication has been the precursor of human speech. Here we present a series of neurophysiological evidences that support this hypothesis. Communication by gestures, denned as the capacity to emit and recognize meaningful actions, may have originated in the monkey motor cortex from a neural system whose basic function was action understanding. This system is made by neurons of monkey's area F5, named mirror neurons, activated by both execution and observation of goal-related actions. Recently, two new categories of mirror neurons have been described. Neurons of one category respond to the sound of an action, neurons of the other category respond to the observation of mouth ingestive and communicative actions. The properties of these neurons indicate that monkey's area F5 possesses the basic neural mechanisms for associating gestures and meaningful sounds as a pre-adaptation for the later emergence of articulated speech. The homology and the functional similarities between monkey area F5 and Broca's area support this evolutionary scenario.

22444846;pi012;Gestures, vocalizations, and memory in language origins;Aboitiz F;Journal Article;This article discusses the possible homologies between the human language networks and comparable auditory projection systems in the macaque brain, in an attempt to reconcile two existing views on language evolution: one that emphasizes hand control and gestures, and the other that emphasizes auditory�vocal mechanisms. The capacity for language is based on relatively well defined neural substrates whose rudiments have been traced in the non-human primate brain. At its core, this circuit constitutes an auditory�vocal sensorimotor circuit with two main components, a 'ventral pathway' connecting anterior auditory regions with anterior ventrolateral prefrontal areas, and a 'dorsal pathway' connecting auditory areas with parietal areas and with posterior ventrolateral prefrontal areas via the arcuate fasciculus and the superior longitudinal fasciculus. In humans, the dorsal circuit is especially important for phonological processing and phonological working memory, capacities that are critical for language acquisition and for complex syntax processing. In the macaque, the homolog of the dorsal circuit overlaps with an inferior parietal�premotor network for hand and gesture selection that is under voluntary control, while vocalizations are largely fixed and involuntary. The recruitment of the dorsal component for vocalization behavior in the human lineage, together with a direct cortical control of the subcortical vocalizing system, are proposed to represent a fundamental innovation in human evolution, generating an inflection point that permitted the explosion of vocal language and human communication. In this context, vocal communication and gesturing have a common history in primate communication.

The strong link between motor functions (hand use and manual gestures) and speech in humans is reviewed. The presence of asymmetrical cerebral organization in nonhuman primates along with functional asymmetries in the perception and production of vocalizations and in intentional referential gestural communication is then emphasized. The nature of primate communicatory systems is presented, and the similarities and differences between these systems and human speech are discussed. It is argued that recent findings concerning neuroanatomical asymmetries in the chimpanzee brain and the existence of both mirror neurons and lateralized use of hands and vocalizations in communication necessitate a reconsideration of the phylogenic emergence of the cerebral and behavioral prerequisites for human speech.

Comparative studies on primate gestures in an evolutionary framework have, however, remained largely restricted to the great apes and the potential flexibility and richness of gestural communication in monkeys, especially in the wild, continue to be virtually unknown. In this paper, we followed several criteria, adapted from ape gesture studies, to identify gestures and evaluate their contexts of usage in the repertoire of wild bonnet macaques Macaca radiata in the Bandipur National Park of southern India. This report is the first of its kind to systematically identify gestures in any wild, non-ape species, thus providing a platform for comparative studies across primate taxa, particularly in our efforts to trace out the phylogenetic origins of language-like markers in the primate lineage, earlier than in the great apes.

The ability to produce them begins to develop in early infancy, and important developments in the production of language occur throughout the first year of life. There are a number of earliest major milestones in early interactional development, before the onset of true language, and the accomplishment of most of them requires the children's learning of motor and/or cognitive skills which were inherited by the human species from its evolutionary ancestors. No doubt these skills include both gestural ones and vocal ones. Thus, formulating the question of language origins as either gestural or vocal dichotomously appears irrelevant. Nonetheless scientists concerned with this issue have been preoccupied with determining which of these two hypotheses should be accepted and which should be rejected. This chapter discusses the history of the debate about language origins; evidence for the gestural theory of language origins; the role of motherese in the intermediate stage of language evolution; implications of music for language evolution; and musical origins of language.

The idea was controversial at the time, and remains so, but it continues to be advocated, and appears to have gained increasing acceptance. From an evolutionary point of view, the idea makes some sense, since nonhuman primates have little if any cortical control over vocalization, but excellent cortical control over the hands and arms. Although language is often identified with speech, it has become abundantly clear that language can exist independently of speech. This chapter discusses the gradual switch to the gestural theory of language origins; the late emergence of vocal speech; the role of the FOXP2 gene; and why speech over gesture.

22445172;pi018;Do mechanical effectiveness and recipient species influence intentional signal laterality in captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)?;"Prieur J; Pika S; Barbu S; Blois-Heulin C";Journal Article;Studying the relationships between the directions of brain lateralization for handedness and language can shed light on mechanisms underlying hemispheric specialization for manipulation and signalling functions. We investigated the influence of manipulation and communication functions and of recipient species (conspecific- versus human-directed communication) on manual laterality in signalling context, taking several factors into account simultaneously. We assessed laterality in 39 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), including 4 manipulators (mechanically effective social actions used to get things done) and 18 gestures (mechanically ineffective social actions implying that the signaller takes the recipient�s response into account). We focused on the following factors: interactional context components (e.g., visual fields of both interactants), degree of use of signals ('rare' for signals performed by only a few subjects in the population or 'common' for signals performed by many subjects), mechanical effectiveness, subjects� sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age and hierarchy), and recipient species. We found a significant population-level right-hand bias for one type of human-directed gesture (slap hand). Mechanical effectiveness influenced laterality: right-hand use was more pronounced for conspecific-directed gestures than for conspecific-directed manipulators. The laterality of conspecific-directed gestures overall did not differ from that of human-directed gestures. However, we found an indirect influence of recipient species on laterality as conspecific- and human-directed gestural lateralities were modulated differently by the position of the recipient in the signaller�s visual field and by signaller�s age. We hypothesize that the communication nature of gestures might have developed from manipulators. Manipulators may have contributed to the emergence and the evolution of the left-lateralized communication system in primates.

Review of monkey and ape communication demonstrates greater flexibility in the use of hands and body than for vocalization. Nonetheless, the gestural repertoire of any group of nonhuman primates is small compared with the vocabulary of any human language and thus, presumably, of the transitional form called protolanguage. We argue that it was the coupling of gestural communication with enhanced capacities for imitation that made possible the emergence of protosign to provide essential scaffolding for protospeech in the evolution of protolanguage. Similarly, we argue against a direct evolutionary path from nonhuman primate vocalization to human speech. The analysis refines aspects of the mirror system hypothesis on the role of the primate brain�s mirror system for manual action in evolution of the human language-ready brain.

Plato's use of satire to broach this topic also points to the fine line between the sublime and the ridiculous that has continued to be a hallmark of this sort of speculation. This paper will present recent evidence supporting the idea that language first arose as visible gesture. This evidence is culled from several lines of research, including research on the neurological underpinnings of gesture, i.e., research on mirror neurons; new research on the gestural communication of African apes; research on the cognitive basis of the signed languages of the deaf; and research on the emergence of new signed languages.

Gesture�speech synchrony has been understood as completely governed by sophisticated neural-cognitive mechanisms. However, gesture�speech synchrony may have its original basis in the resonating forces that travel through the body. In the current preregistered study, movements with high physical impact affected phonation in line with gesture�speech synchrony as observed in natural contexts. Rhythmic beating of the arms entrained phonation acoustics (F0 and the amplitude envelope). Such effects were absent for a condition with low-impetus movements (wrist movements) and a condition without movement. Further, movement�phonation synchrony was more pronounced when participants were standing as opposed to sitting, indicating a mediating role for postural stability. We conclude that gesture�speech synchrony has a biomechanical basis, which will have implications for our cognitive, ontogenetic, and phylogenetic understanding of multimodal language.

As evidence for an alternative view, we first review the growing body of research related to iconicity in vocalizations, including experimental work on sound symbolism, cross-linguistic studies documenting iconicity in the grammars and lexicons of languages, and experimental studies that examine iconicity in the production of speech and vocalizations. We then report an experiment in which participants created vocalizations to communicate 60 different meanings, including 30 antonymic pairs. The vocalizations were measured along several acoustic properties, and these properties were compared between antonyms. Participants were highly consistent in the kinds of sounds they produced for the majority of meanings, supporting the hypothesis that vocalization has considerable potential for iconicity. In light of these findings, we present a comparison between vocalization and manual gesture, and examine the detailed ways in which each modality can function in the iconic expression of particular kinds of meanings. We further discuss the role of iconic vocalizations and gesture in the evolution of language since our divergence from the great apes. In conclusion, we suggest that human communication is best understood as an ensemble of kinesis and vocalization, not just speech, in which expression in both modalities spans the range from arbitrary to iconic.

23080867;pi024;Language, gesture, and emotional communication: An embodied view of social interaction;"De Stefani E; De Marco D";Journal Article;Spoken language is an innate ability of the human being and represents the most widespread mode of social communication. The ability to share concepts, intentions and feelings, and also to respond to what others are feeling/saying is crucial during social interactions. A growing body of evidence suggests that language evolved from manual gestures, gradually incorporating motor acts with vocal elements. In this evolutionary context, the human mirror mechanism (MM) would permit the passage from 'doing something' to 'communicating it to someone else.' In this perspective, the MM would mediate semantic processes being involved in both the execution and in the understanding of messages expressed by words or gestures. Thus, the recognition of action related words would activate somatosensory regions, reflecting the semantic grounding of these symbols in action information. Here, the role of the sensorimotor cortex and in general of the human MM on both language perception and understanding is addressed, focusing on recent studies on the integration between symbolic gestures and speech. We conclude documenting some evidence about MM in coding also the emotional aspects conveyed by manual, facial and body signals during communication, and how they act in concert with language to modulate other�s message comprehension and behavior, in line with an 'embodied' and integrated view of social interaction.

22445421;pi026;The evolutionary socioecology of gestural communication;Blute M;Journal Article;This paper begins with a brief introduction to gestures in the context of communication, multi-process selection theory, and evolutionary socioecology. Evolutionary ecology asks, and seeks to answer the question of under what ecological conditions selection favors what kinds of characteristics including the behavioral characteristics oriented towards the physical environment and other species. While communication is sometimes involved in interactions among species, it is most prevalent among members of the same population or species. Evolutionary socioecology then asks and seeks to answer the same question about ecologically versus socially oriented characteristics as well as about the purely social. In discussing some general principles of the evolutionary socioecology of communication including gestures, this paper pays particular attention to the sometimes cooperative, sometimes antagonistic, and often mixed nature of social communication.

In the original article, the values of the columns 'SE HI' and 't test' were not correctly reported in Table 2. Correction is present in the erratum.] Investigations of intraspecific laterality of primates' gestural communication aim to shed light on the evolutionary origins of human handedness and language. Currently, little is known concerning laterality of gestures for purely intraspecific communication. As far as we know, this study is the first to assess laterality of gorillas' purely intraspecific gestures at the population level. We analysed hand use in dyadic interactions in 35 gorillas, Gorilla gorilla gorilla, living in three groups in captivity focusing on their most frequent communication gesture types. We revealed a right-hand bias at the population level for the majority of the most frequent gestures recorded. Our findings support the evolutionary theories predicting that population level asymmetry should be found in fitness-relevant social behaviours and could be explained by an evolutionarily stable strategy based on intraspecific interactions. They also agree with reports evidencing predominant right-hand use for gestural communication by nonhuman primates and suggesting that gestural laterality is a precursor of the left-hemispheric lateralization of language.

22444968;pi028;Language origin accounts: Was the gesture in the beginning?;"Bonvillian J D; Garber A M; Dell S B";Journal Article;Provides a brief review of various historical claims that children acquired particular spoken languages without benefit of speech input. In the Greek historian Herodotus' account of a language study by King Psammetichus of Ancient Egypt, the 1st word spoken by children reared without speech input was 'bekos,' the Phrygian word for bread. The authors examine this research. There are several aspects of this study that lend credence to Herodotus' depiction. They also advance several reasons for questioning the accuracy of Herodotus' account. Other authors' descriptions of subsequent historical studies and their particular outcomes similarly are questioned. Armed with this background information, they then review the evidence for a notable language origin study conducted more than 400 yrs ago by Akbar, Emperor of Hindustan. The outcome of this investigation, however, was quite different from those of the other language origin experiments. These children failed to acquire speech, but instead apparently made use of gestures (or signs) to communicate. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of this finding for clarifying questions about the emergence of a 1st language.

Twenty_four participants (aged 10_11 years) in two locations�primary school classrooms located 300 miles apart in the UK�engaged in simultaneous collaborative activity to solve a History mystery task. Audio_video data recorded in the first minute of the activity were analysed to explore the emergence of collaborative working practices both within groups in the same location (resizing for shared reading) and between the groups communicating via video conferencing software and through the 'flick' multi_touch gesture (sharing clues between groups). The results indicated that most groups focused first on the establishment of intra_group collaboration before reaching out to their remotely located partners. However, when the second data set was analysed, audio data from delayed interviews conducted after the original study, participants reported that the discussion between groups supported by the 'flick' gesture was the most important and memorable feature of the activity. The study relates these findings to the existing literature on collaborative learning using multi_touch tables and considers how teachers are best able to help support the emergence of collaborative practices.

22445039;pi030;The structural effects of modality on the rise of symbolic language: A rebuttal of evolutionary accounts and a laboratory demonstration;"Boucher V; Gilbert A; Rossier-Bisaillon A";Journal Article;Why does symbolic communication in humans develop primarily in an oral medium, and how do theories of language origin explain this? Non-human primates, despite their ability to learn and use symbolic signs, do not develop symbols as in oral language. This partly owes to the lack of a direct cortico-motoneuron control of vocalizations in these species compared to humans. Yet such modality-related factors that can impinge on the rise of symbolic language are interpreted differently in two types of evolutionary storylines. (1) Some theories posit that symbolic language originated in a gestural modality, as in 'sign languages.' However, this overlooks work on emerging sign and spoken languages showing that gestures and speech shape signs differently. (2) In modality-dependent theories, some emphasize the role of iconic sounds, though these lack the efficiency of arbitrary symbols. Other theorists suggest that ontogenesis serves to identify human-specific mechanisms underlying an evolutionary shift from pitch varying to orally modulated vocalizations (babble). This shift creates numerous oral features that can support efficient symbolic associations. We illustrate this principle using a sound-picture association task with 40 learners who hear words in an unfamiliar language (Mandarin) with and without a filtering of oral features. Symbolic associations arise more rapidly and accurately for sounds containing oral features compared to sounds bearing only pitch features, an effect also reported in experiments with infants. The results imply that, beyond a competence to learn and use symbols, the rise of symbolic language rests on the types of signs that a modality of expression affords.

22444885;pi032;Launching language: The gestural origin of discrete infinity;"Studdert-Kennedy M; Goldstein L";Book Chapter;According to the particulate principle of self-diversifying systems, a necessary condition for the evolution of discrete infinity--a property on which every language, spoken or signed, is based--was the evolution of a finite set of discrete phonetic units. Since production is logically prior to perception, a necessary condition for the evolution of these units was an integral neuroanatomical system of potentially independent movable parts (such as the hand, the face, or the vocal apparatus) that could be differentiated to effect rapid, coordinated strings of discrete motor actions, or gestures. Under pressure for mutually intelligible imitative exchange, the vocal apparatus differentiated evolutionarily into six neuromotorically independent structures (lips, tongue tip, tongue body, tongue root, velum, and larynx) capable of effecting discrete changes in vocal tract configuration. By hypothesis, these organs provide the universal biologically determined base for discrete units of phonetic action in every language. Different languages then expand and elaborate the basic gestural phonology by sociocultural processes of attunement among speakers through mutual vocal mimicry, resulting in differentiation of gestures produced by a given organ and coordination of gestures into larger complex structures. The imitative processes of learning to speak and of mutual attunement among speakers of a language may have evolved by means of specialized, somatotopically organized systems of mirror neurons of the type observed for manual action in the macaque monkey.

22445632;pi034;Gestural communication of the gorilla (Gorilla gorilla): Repertoire, intentionality and possible origins;"Genty E; Breuer T; Hobaiter C; Byrne R";Journal Article;Social groups of gorillas were observed in three captive facilities and one African field site. Cases of potential gesture use, totalling 9,540, were filtered by strict criteria for intentionality, giving a corpus of 5,250 instances of intentional gesture use. This indicated a repertoire of 102 gesture types. Most repertoire differences between individuals and sites were explicable as a consequence of environmental affordances and sampling effects: overall gesture frequency was a good predictor of universality of occurrence. Only one gesture was idiosyncratic to a single individual, and was given only to humans. Indications of cultural learning were few, though not absent. Six gestures appeared to be traditions within single social groups, but overall concordance in repertoires was almost as high between as within social groups. No support was found for the ontogenetic ritualization hypothesis as the chief means of acquisition of gestures. Many gestures whose form ruled out such an origin, i.e. gestures derived from species-typical displays, were used as intentionally and almost as flexibly as gestures whose form was consistent with learning by ritualization. When using both classes of gesture, gorillas paid specific attention to the attentional state of their audience. Thus, it would be unwarranted to divide ape gestural repertoires into �innate, species-typical, inflexible reactions� and �individually learned, intentional, flexible communication�. We conclude that gorilla gestural communication is based on a species-typical repertoire, like those of most other mammalian species but very much larger. Gorilla gestures are not, however, inflexible signals but are employed for intentional communication to specific individuals.

22445563;pi035;Merging of phonological and gestural circuits in early language evolution;"Aboitiz F; García R";Journal Article;"In the monkey, cortical auditory projections subdivide into a dorsal stream mostly involved in spatiotemporal processing, that projects mainly to dorsal frontal areas; and a ventral stream involved in stimulus identification, connected to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). We propose that in the human lineage, part of the dorsal auditory pathway has specialized in vocalization processing, enhancing vocal repetition and short-term memory capacities that are crucial for linguistic development. In the human, the vocalization-related dorsal auditory component tends to converge in the VLPFC with the ventral auditory stream and with projections involved in gestural control; and consists of a direct connection between the auditory cortex and the VLPFC via the arcuate fasciculus, and an indirect pathway via the supramarginal gyrus. Additionally, intraparietal and inferior parietal afferents to the VLPFC are associated with communicative hand gestures, with manipulation skills and with early tool-making. Although in general terms compatible with the mirror-neuron gestural hypothesis for language origins, this proposal underlines the participation of the dorsal auditory pathway in voice processing as a key event that marked the beginning of human phonology and the subsequent evolution of language. Instead, the mirror neuron system for gestures and the primitive vocalization network (ventral pathway) contributed to provide a communicative scaffolding that facilitated the emergence of human-like phonology. Furthermore, we emphasize the phylogenetic continuity (homology) between non-human and human vocalization and their neural substrates, something that is not usually stressed in the mirror neuron perspective.

At present, no such legacy of shared gesture has been described in humans. We suggest that the fate of 'ape gestures' in modern human communication is relevant to the debate regarding the evolution of language through a possible intermediate stage of gestural protolanguage.

A simplistic human/animal partition is no longer tenable, and we review four (nonexclusive) possible drivers for the origin of population-level right-handedness: skilled manipulative activity, as in tool use; communicative gestures; organizational complexity of action, in particular hierarchical structure; and the role of intentionality in goal-directed action.

We assessed laterality of 39 chimpanzees in a non-communication action similar to termite fishing that we compared with data on five frequent conspecific-directed gestures involving a tool previously exploited in the same subjects. We evaluated, first, population-level manual laterality for tool-use in non-communication actions; second, the influence of sociodemographic factors (age, sex, group, and hierarchy) on manual laterality in both non-communication actions and gestures. No significant right-hand bias at the population level was found for non-communication tool use, contrary to our previous findings for gestures involving a tool. A multifactorial analysis revealed that hierarchy and age particularly modulated manual laterality. Dominants and immatures were more right-handed when using a tool in gestures than in non-communication actions. On the contrary, subordinates, adolescents, young and mature adults as well as males were more right-handed when using a tool in non-communication actions than in gestures. Our findings support the hypothesis that some primate species may have a specific left-hemisphere processing gestures distinct from the cerebral system processing non-communication manual actions and to partly support the tool use hypothesis.

22445182;pi040;From hand to mouth: The gestural origins of language;Corballis M C;Book Chapter;The overall evolutionary scenario may have gone something like this: With the emergence of bipedalism, the early hominins evolved more sophisticated ways to gesture to one another than their immediate primate ancestors. But these gestures may still have consisted of relatively isolated signs until around two million years ago, when brain size increased and migrations out of Africa began. This may have led to the combining of gestures to form new meanings, and perhaps the beginnings of narrative. Thus, eventually, was syntax born. Some of the most profound cultural revolutions have come about through changes in the ways in which we communicate with one another. Consider the impact of the inventions of writing, of printing, of the telephone, of the computer, of the internet. No doubt it was the development of syntax, perhaps in the context of gesture, that helped lift human culture to a level of complexity well beyond that of our primate forebears, and it may well have been the shift to autonomous speech that led to the cultural upheavals of 50,000 years ago.

22445435;pi041;Complex sociality of wild chimpanzees can emerge from laterality of manual gestures;"Roberts A; Murray L; Roberts S";Journal Article;Humans are strongly lateralized for manual gestures at both individual and population levels. In contrast, the laterality bias in primates is less strong, leading some to suggest that lateralization evolved after the Pan and Homo lineages diverged. However, laterality in humans is also context-dependent, suggesting that observed differences in lateralization between primates and humans may be related to external factors such as the complexity of the social environment. Here we address this question in wild chimpanzees and examine the extent to which the laterality of manual gestures is associated with social complexity. Right-handed gestures were more strongly associated with goal-directed communication such as repair through elaboration in response to communication failure than left-handed gestures. Right-handed gestures occurred in evolutionarily urgent contexts such as in interactions with central individuals in the network, including grooming reciprocity and mating, whereas left-handed gestures occurred in less-urgent contexts, such as travel and play. Right-handed gestures occurred in smaller parties and in the absence of social competition relative to left-handed gestures. Right-handed gestures increased the rate of activities indicating high physiological arousal in the recipient, whereas left-handed gestures reduced it. This shows that right- and left-handed gestures differ in cognitive and social complexity, with right-handed gestures facilitating more complex interactions in simpler social settings, whereas left-handed gestures facilitate more rewarding interactions in complex social settings. Differences in laterality between other primates and humans are likely to be driven by differences in the complexity of both the cognitive skills underpinning social interactions and the social environment.

This study assesses gorillas� intraspecific gestural laterality considering the effect of various factors related to gestural characteristics, interactional context and sociodemographic characteristics of signaller and recipient. Our question was: which factors influence gorillas� gestural laterality? We studied laterality in three captive groups of gorillas (N = 35) focusing on their most frequent gesture types (N = 16). We show that signallers used predominantly their hand ipsilateral to the recipient for tactile and visual gestures, whatever the emotional context, gesture duration, recipient�s sex or the kin relationship between both interactants, and whether or not a communication tool was used. Signallers� contralateral hand was not preferentially used in any situation. Signallers� right-hand use was more pronounced in negative contexts, in short gestures, when signallers were females and its use increased with age. Our findings showed that gorillas� gestural laterality could be influenced by different types of social pressures thus supporting the theory of the evolution of laterality at the population level. Our study also evidenced that some particular gesture categories are better markers than others of the left-hemisphere language specialization.

Communicating events through pantomime with and without vocalization;"Zlatev J; Wacewicz S; Zywiczynski P; van de Weijer J";Journal Article;A persistent controversy in language evolution research has been whether language emerged in the gestural-visual or in the vocal-auditory modality. A 'dialectic' solution to this age-old debate has now been gaining ground: language was fully multimodal from the start and remains so to this day. In this paper, we show this solution to be too simplistic and outline a more specific theoretical proposal, which we designate as pantomime-first. To decide between the multimodal-first and pantomime-first alternatives, we review several lines of interdisciplinary evidence and complement it with a cognitive-semiotic experiment. In the study, the participants saw�and then matched to hand-drawn images�recordings of short transitive events enacted by 4 actors in two conditions: visual (only body movement) and multimodal (body movement accompanied by nonlinguistic vocalization). Significantly, the matching accuracy was greater in the visual than the multimodal condition, though a follow-up experiment revealed that the emotional profiles of the events enacted in the multimodal condition could be reliably detected from the sound alone. We see these results as supporting the proposed pantomime-first scenario.

22444881;pi045;What is meant by 'multimodal therapy' for aphasia?;"Pierce J E; O'Halloran R; Togher L; Rose M L";Journal Article;Purpose: Multimodal therapy is a frequent term in aphasia literature, but it has no agreed upon definition. Phrases such as 'multimodal therapy' and 'multimodal treatment' are applied to a range of aphasia interventions as if mutually understood, and yet, the interventions reported in the literature differ significantly in methodology, approach, and aims. This inconsistency can be problematic for researchers, policy makers, and clinicians accessing the literature and potentially compromises data synthesis and meta-analysis. A literature review was conducted to examine what types of aphasia treatment are labeled multimodal and determine whether any patterns are present. Method: A systematic search was conducted to identify literature pertaining to aphasia that included the term multimodal therapy (and variants). Sources included literature databases, dissertation databases, textbooks, professional association websites, and Google Scholar. Results: Thirty-three original articles were identified, as well as another 31 sources referring to multimodal research, all of which used a variant of the term multimodal therapy. Treatments had heterogeneous aims, underlying theories, and methods. The rationale for using more than 1 modality was not always clear, nor was the reason each therapy was considered to be multimodal when similar treatments had not used the title. Treatments were noted to differ across 2 key features. The 1st was whether the ultimate aim of intervention was to improve total communication, as in augmentative and alternative communication approaches, or to improve 1 specific modality, as when gesture is used to improve word retrieval. The 2nd was the point in the treatment that the nonspeech modalities were employed. Discussion: Our review demonstrated that references to 'multimodal' treatments represent very different therapies with little consistency. We propose a framework to define and categorize multimodal treatments, which is based both on our results and on current terminology in speech-language pathology.

22445564;pi046;Challenges facing the study of the evolutionary origins of human right-handedness and language;"Prieur J; Lemasson A; Barbu S; Blois-Heulin C";Journal Article;"A growing consensus favors the predominance of the human left hemisphere in manipulation and language (speech and gestures). However, the mechanisms underlying brain lateralization for noncommunication and communication functions are still unclear. Many studies emphasize the ambiguous nature of the relationship between the directions of brain lateralization for manipulation and for language. A comparative evolutionary approach investigating lateralization and communication mechanisms in our closest living relatives can improve our understanding of human hemispheric specialisation. We review theories concerning the evolutionary origins of human right-handedness and language and studies, highlighting the relevance of a comparative evolutionary approach. We discuss four methodological issues related to the study of handedness and communication: 1) categorisation of signaling based on criteria of intentionality; 2) use of a comprehensive multimodal and multifactorial approach; 3) investigation of laterality in intraspecific gestures; and 4) comparison of manual laterality between gestures and noncommunication actions. Deeper investigations of the multifaceted nature of intentionality in communication and the multidimensionality of manual laterality and communication in humans and other primates are needed. Finally, we make four recommendations to enhance our understanding of the evolutionary origins of human right-handedness and language: 1) implementing a comprehensive and integrated investigation of laterality and communication; 2) considering socioecologically relevant contexts; 3) investigating intraspecific aspects of communication in humans and other primates that vary in their degree of sociality; and 4) using appropriate, standardized methods of data collection and analysis.

We demonstrate that use of these behaviors accompanying visual gestures in pairs of wild chimpanzees was related to the amount of time pairs of chimpanzees spent in proximity. Central individuals in the community had a larger network of relationships maintained through gestures accompanied by synchronized pant-hoot calls. Thus, these behaviors may increase the efficiency of gestural communication in social bonding. More broadly, these results illustrate the importance of different types of communication in managing different types of social relationships in nonhuman primates and other species.

This study contrasted the abilities of chimpanzees (N = 11) and 4-year-old human children (N = 24) to comprehend novel iconic gestures. Participants learned to retrieve rewards from apparatuses in two distinct locations, each requiring a different action. In the test, a human adult informed the participant where to go by miming the action needed to obtain the reward. Children used the iconic gestures (more than arbitrary gestures) to locate the reward, whereas chimpanzees did not. Some children also used arbitrary gestures in the same way, but only after they had previously shown comprehension for iconic gestures. Over time, chimpanzees learned to associate iconic gestures with the appropriate location faster than arbitrary gestures, suggesting at least some recognition of the iconicity involved. These results demonstrate the importance of iconicity in referential communication.

22445674;pi051;The gestural origins of language;Corballis M C;Journal Article;"The idea that language evolved from manual gestures rather than primate calls dates back at least to the 18th century, and was revived in modern form by the anthropologist, Gordon W. Hewes, in 1973. The main sources of current evidence are: (1) Signed languages invented by deaf communities share with speech the essential characteristics of language, including such properties as reference, generativity, grammar, and prosody; (2) Great apes in captivity are much better able to learn intentional communication systems based on manual gestures than to acquire speech; (3) The manual gestures of chimpanzees in the wild are more flexible and context_independent than their vocalizations; (4) The mirror system in the primate brain provides a natural platform for the evolution of language; it represents manual gestures and some nonvocal oral movements, but not vocalizations. Vocal gestures were probably incorporated into the mirror system late in hominin evolution, perhaps only with the emergence of our own species, Homo sapiens.

22445379;pi052;Motor acts and communicative gestures from 9 to 18 months of age in imperative and declarative context: Tracing the origin and development of pointing;"Aureli T; Perucchini P; Iverson J M ";Journal Article;According to Vygotskyan and Werner & Kaplan's perspectives, precursors of pointing gestures can be identified in either reaching or index finger extension. Within the same perspective, Carpendale & Carpendale (2010) found that pointing emerges in daily life as a nonsocial orienting behavior, which eventually becomes a communicative de-vice. The present study shares with Carpendale & Carpendale the aim of investigating the origins of pointing as related to the infant's activity. We observed infant's behaviours in a paradigm devised to elicit communicative pointing, either to request an interesting object by the adult (imperative pointing) or to involve the adult in attending to an interesting object (declarative pointing). The aim was to explore how infants use their behavioural repertoire to achieve these goals and how this repertoire is influenced by the goal to achieve. Ten infants were tested every three months�from 9 to 18 months�with three trials for imperative and three trials for declarative pointing. Each trial was coded considering all behaviors produced by the infant after the activation of the stimulus. The categories used were Pointing, Reaching, Only finger and Motor act. At any age, the frequency of infant productions was much higher in the imperative than in the declarative condition, increasing gradually in both of them. The quality of the infant's participation in interactions changed with age, from non-communicative to communicative modalities, and from motor acts to conventionalized behaviors, such as pointing and reaching gesture. Moreover, the context and the goal of her/his actions influenced the child's behavioral repertoire: imperative intention was expressed by reaching as well as pointing, and declarative intention was expressed only by pointing.

22445354;pi053;The function of primate multimodal communication;"Frohlich M; van Schaik C P";Journal Article;Language is commonly narrowed down to speech, but human face-to-face communication is in fact an intrinsically multimodal phenomenon. Despite growing evidence that the communication of non-human primates, our main model for the evolution of language, is also inherently multimodal, most studies on primate communication have focused on either gestures or vocalizations in isolation. Accordingly, the biological function of multimodal signalling remains poorly understood. In this paper, we aim to merge the perspectives of comparative psychology and behavioural ecology on multimodal communication, and review existing studies in great apes for evidence of multimodal signal function based on content-based, efficacy-based and inter-signal interaction hypotheses. We suggest that cross-species comparisons of great ape interactions in both captive and wild settings will allow us to test the conditions in which these hypotheses apply. We expect such studies to provide novel insights into the function of speech-accompanying signals and cues, such as gestures, facial expressions, and eye gaze.

22444891;pi055;Origins of sign languages;"Armstrong DF; Wilcox S";Book Chapter;"This chapter maintains that human languages emerge from purposeful human behavior, the most common of which are visible gestural behaviors. We further suggest that sign languages were probably the first human languages. These assertions are based on the observation that gestural communication is exhibited by all of the Hominoidea, the primate superfamily that includes apes and human beings; the fact that iconic and indexic gestures have been identified in the behavior of feral chimpanzees; and by noting that this sort of behavior was probably part of the repertoire of the common ancestors of chimpanzees and humans, thus of the earliest hominids. We propose an evolutionary model for the emergence of language based on semantic phonology and further demonstrate how spoken languages developed subsequently out of vocal gestures. Rationales are provided for the eventual predominance of speech as the primary medium for human language and for the maintenance of sign systems and gestural systems in conjunction with speech by hearing communities. Finally, we discuss evidence for the emergence of full sign languages whenever numbers of deaf people reach critical mass. Key aspects of this discussion include homesigns and sign systems used in small scale societies with significant numbers of deaf members; the earliest evidence for deaf communities with sign languages; the origin of Langue des Signes Fran�aise and ASL; and the origin and elaboration of Nicaraguan Sign Language, especially with respect to what the emergence of a new language tells us about the human language faculty.

22445550;pi056;Nonverbal communication: Origins, adaptation, and functionality;Fernandez-Dols J M;Book Chapter;This chapter deals with the origins and functions of two ways of human communication beyond language: nonverbal communication and animal communication. Nonverbal communication includes all those kinds of human behavior that are not strictly linguistic but convey meaning, i.e., a set of behaviors (e.g., gestures) with a specific referential value and a function. Animal communication are processes of mutual interactive influence between two or more individuals in which some key ingredients of human communication (shared code, attribution of mental states, and meaning) are missing. Exploring vestigial forms of animal communication (e.g. laughter) in contemporary humans can provide psychological sciences with some keys to the understanding of the origins and functions of verbal and nonverbal communication. The take-home message of this chapter is that the co-existence of animal communication and nonverbal communication in humans constitutes an amazing evolutionary phenomenon with two important features: (a) the meaning of nonverbal communication is language-dependent, and the meaning of animal communication is context-dependent, (b) Pure animal communication is probably impossible in humans, as the complex interconnections between all the brain regions make it extremely difficult to conceive of any encapsulated module totally isolated from the neural circuits that give rise to language.

22444988;pi057;Communicative mediation by adults in the construction of symbolic uses by infants;"Palacios P; Rodríguez C; Méndez-Sánchez C";Journal Article;Adult semiotic mediation in the origin and evolution of the first symbolic uses of objects by infants in contexts of triadic interactions was investigated. Six infant-parent dyads interacting together with ten objects were observed longitudinally from 9 to 15 months of age, with an interval of three months between each observation. The communicative mediators used by adults, in the form of demonstrations and ostensive gestures, decrease as infants grow up. The orchestration of these semiotic mediators also decreases and the functions of the demonstrations change. At the beginning, the adults use them merely to demonstrate the symbolic uses of object, but later they use them to evaluate, complete or correct the symbolic uses by the infants. The semiotic mediators are first used to guide the child at the level of attention and later at the level of cultural practices of symbolic uses of objects. These changes in communicative mediators and their functions reveal the educational role of adults through adjustment in communication, always in tune with the infant�s knowledge and performance.

22445161;pi059;The development of gestural communication in great apes;"Frohlich M; Hobaiter C";Journal Article;Abstract: Great apes deploy gestural signals in goal-directed and flexible ways across a wide range of social contexts. Despite growing evidence for profound effects of developmental experience on social cognition, socio-ecological factors shaping gesture use are still poorly understood, particularly in apes living in their natural environment. After discussing current ambiguities in terminology and methods, we review recent work implementing a longitudinal and/or cross-sectional approach in great ape gesture acquisition (phylogenetic and ontogenetic origins) and development (ontogenetic trajectories). To understand whether and to what extent the socio-ecological environment influences gestural communication, it is essential to distinguish between the gestural repertoire and gesture usage, which represent different levels of analysis. While the majority of the apes� gestural repertoire seems to be innate, accumulating evidence shows that the communicative usage of these signals is substantially affected by interactional experiences throughout ontogeny. Nevertheless, since great ape communication is intrinsically multimodal, future developmental research on gesture should incorporate other modes of communication. Significance statement: Great apes navigate their differentiated social relationships by means of a large and flexible repertoire of gestures. However, gestural ontogeny is still poorly understood, particularly in primates living in their natural environment. We first discuss how the different usages of the term �gesture� have led to a number of apparently disparate views, but highlight that these perspectives each provide their own contribution and may be reconciled by considering them as different levels of explanation. We then review recent studies on the various individual and social factors shaping the gestural use in great apes throughout development, highlighting the impact of socio-ecological factors. While the majority of the apes� gestural repertoire seems to be innate, the communicative usage of these signals is substantially affected by interactional experiences throughout ontogeny. Given that ape gestural signals are inherently multimodal and are then often combined with other communicative signals, a broad multimodal perspective on gesture is important in order to gain a thorough understanding of the developmental processes underlying great ape communication.

22445263;pi060;William C Stokoe and the gestural theory of language origins;Wilcox S E;Book Chapter;Presents a commemoration of William C. Stokoe, one of the most influential language scholars of the twentieth century. Bill Stokoe also was an architect of ideas. His ideas have a simple beauty that belies the radical way in which they have changed our intellectual landscape. Bill Stokoe is known for his most famous idea: that the signs he saw his deaf students using at Gallaudet University were a language. This discussion focuses on another of Stokoe's grand ideas: the idea that language began as gesture. Stokoe would be the first to point out that the gestural theory of language origins is not his unique creation. His ideas contributed to modern gestural theory and is expressed most succinctly in a notion that unites his two grand ideas�the notion of semantic phonology. Semantic phonology is elegant because it captures the simplicity and the power of visible gestures. Also gestural theory makes predictions concerning the neural architecture of the perceptual, motor, and cognitive systems underlying gesture and language. Stokoe's idea that signed languages are true human languages is now well�accepted, so much so that it seems impossible that anyone could have thought otherwise.

23080801;pi061;Enhanced multi-objective particle swarm optimisation for estimating hand postures;"Saremi S; Mirjalili S; Lewis A; Liew A W C; Dong J S";Journal Article;Multi-objective problems with conflicting objectives cannot be effectively solved by aggregation-based methods. The answer to such problems is a Pareto optimal solution set. Due to the difficulty of solving multi-objective problems using multi-objective algorithms and the lack of enough expertise, researchers in different fields tend to aggregative objectives and use single-objective algorithms. This work is a seminal attempt to propose the use of multi-objective algorithms in the field of hand posture estimation. Hand posture estimation is a key step in hand gesture recognition, which is a part of an overall attempt to make human-computer interaction more like human face-to-face communication. Hand posture estimation is first formulated as a bi-objective problem. A modified version of Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimisation (MOPSO) is then proposed to approximate the Pareto optimal font of 50 different postures. The main motivation of integrating a new operator (called Evolutionary Population Dynamics�EPD) in MOPSO is due to the nature of hand posture estimation problems in which parameters should not be tuned in a same manner since they show varied impacts on the objectives. EPD allows randomising different parameters in a solution and provides different exploratory behaviours for the parameters of an optimisation algorithm rather than each individual solution. The MOPSO algorithm is equipped with a mechanism to randomly re-initialise poor particles around the optimal solutions in the archive. The improved MOPSO is tested on ZDT and CEC2009 test functions and compared with the standard MOPSO, NSGAII, and MOEA/D. The results show that the proposed MOPSO (MOPSO + EPD) significantly outperforms MOPSO on the majority of test functions in terms of both convergence and coverage. MOPSO + EPD also approximates well-distributed Pareto optimal fronts for most of the postures considered in this work. The post analysis of the results is conducted to understand the relationship between the parameters and objectives of this problem (design principals) for the first time in the literature as well.

23080850;pi062;More is up�Important is central: Impact of developmental origin of image schemas on touch and gesture interaction with computers;Nowack K;Journal Article;Image schemas and primary metaphors have been studied extensively in cognitive linguistics, but insufficiently in the applied context of human-computer interaction. Scant evidence proposes image schemas and primary metaphors as sources for intuitive interface design. Literature on concept formation, however, suggests that image schemas occurring earlier in infancy exert greater influence than later developed image schemas on the development of thought and language. To investigate the impact of developmental origin of image schemas on the validity of image-schematic metaphors in supporting intuitive interface design, two studies analyzed metaphor strengths of image schemas from questionnaire, and from gesture and touch interaction with a 2D interactive interface. Responses linked to primary metaphors associated with early image schemas demonstrated greater agreement rates compared to late image schemas. Whilst questionnaire and touch responses generally demonstrated metaphor strengths well above chance level, gesture responses were only above chance level for early but not for late image schemas. For the application of image-schematic metaphors in intuitive interfaces, the current findings suggest two restrictions: First, primary metaphors linked to early image schemas appear to be more intuitive than those linked to late image schemas. This impact of developmental occurrence of image schemas is interpreted in terms of differences in complexity and frequency. Second, image-schematic primary metaphors appear more suited for providing intuitive touch interaction experiences. For intuitive gesture interaction experiences, they appear less suited.

22445411;pi063;On space geckos and urban apes: Animals thinking outside the box;Call J;Book Chapter;Recent studies have revealed that the great apes possess more sophisticated abilities of prospective cognition and displaced reference than their natural behavior had suggested. This chapter makes a case for studying cognition precisely beyond those boundaries in order to obtain a more complete picture of a species potential. It argues that testing nonhuman animals outside their 'natural' box is needed to fully probe their capabilities and limitations, something that is particularly desirable if our ultimate goal is to reconstruct the evolution of cognition. The chapter presents the two main approaches that have been used to investigate comparative cognition: anthropocentric approach and ecological approach. It discusses the issue of flexibility and the central role that it plays in the study of cognition, particularly in problem solving and creativity. The chapter also discusses three main types of adaptation and the role cognition plays in them. Then the author illustrates the main point of the chapter with two examples: tool use and gestural communication in apes. The chapter ends with some remarks regarding the causes and consequences of quasi-ecological data and makes a call for combining such data with those originating in the natural habitat.

22445029;pi064;Constructing complexity in a young sign language;"Dachkovsky S; Stamp R; Sandler W";Journal Article;"A universally acknowledged, core property of language is its complexity, at each level of structure�sounds, words, phrases, clauses, utterances, and higher levels of discourse. How does this complexity originate and develop in a language? We cannot fully answer this question from spoken languages, since they are all thousands of years old or descended from old languages. However, sign languages of deaf communities can arise at any time and provide empirical data for testing hypotheses related to the emergence of language complexity. An added advantage of the signed modality is a correspondence between visible physical articulations and linguistic structures, providing a more transparent view of linguistic complexity and its emergence (Sandler, 2012). These essential characteristics of sign languages allow us to address the issue of emerging complexity by documenting the use of the body for linguistic purposes. We look at three types of discourse relations of increasing complexity motivated by research on spoken languages�additive, symmetric, and asymmetric (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Sanders et al., 1992). Each relation type can connect units at two different levels: within propositions (simpler) and across propositions (more complex)._ We hypothesized that these relations provide a measure for charting the time course of emergence of complexity, from simplest to most complex, in a new sign language. We test this hypothesis on Israeli Sign Language (ISL), a young language, some of whose earliest users are still available for recording. Taking advantage of the unique relation in sign languages between bodily articulations and linguistic form, we study fifteen ISL signers from three generations, and demonstrate that the predictions indeed hold. We also find that younger signers tend to converge on more systematic marking of relations, that they use fewer articulators for a given linguistic function than older signers, and that the form of articulations becomes reduced, as the language matures. Mapping discourse relations to the bodily expression of linguistic components across age groups reveals how simpler, less constrained, and more gesture-like expressions, become language.

The current issue can of course only provide a glimpse on this exciting and vibrant field of research, but it hopefully demonstrates that there are some new and interesting avenues and developments. The aim of this chapter is to identify foci of ongoing research as well as blind spots, such as remaining questions and unsolved debates that need to be addressed in future research into gestural communication of primates. Most of the contributions to this volume concern gesture use in non-human primates. This is not to suggest that there is no exciting research going on with regards to investigating gesture acquisition in pre-verbal children or in speech-accompanying gestures. However, gesture research in non-human primates is currently expanding at much higher rate with many more researchers now working on a variety of species in the framework of language evolution and in hope of discovering similarities between gestures used by humans and other primates to shed light on the evolution of human language.

22445657;pi066;A multifactorial investigation of captive chimpanzees' intraspecific gestural laterality;"Prieur J; Pika S; Barbu S; Blois-Heulin C";Journal Article;"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 124 of Animal Behaviour (see record [rid]2017-07513-006[/rid]). In Table 2 of the original article, the t values of the column 't test' were not correctly reported. A corrected Table 2 is provided in the erratum.] Social laterality is the core of two major theories: one concerns the evolution of laterality at the population level and the other the evolution of human language. However, few studies have investigated gestural laterality in communication between conspecifics. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate the production of intraspecific gestures taking into account the influence of multiple factors on gestural laterality: first, gestural characteristics (sensory modality, use of a communication tool, sharing degree in the population and duration); second, the interactional context (visual field and body sides of signaller and recipient, and emotional context); and third, individual sociodemographic characteristics of signaller and recipient (age, sex, group, hierarchy, affiliation and kinship). We questioned, first, whether gestural laterality differed with gesture at the population level and second, whether some factors influenced gestural laterality. To do so, we evaluated social laterality in dyadic interactions in 39 chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, living in three groups in captivity. We found that, at the population level, 13 of the 21 gestures we observed were performed predominantly with the right hand. Gestural laterality of signallers was influenced mainly by interactional context, gesture characteristics (except gesture duration) and signallers' hierarchical rank and age. Signallers used their hand ipsilateral to recipients for tactile and visual gestures and their contralateral hand for gestures involving auditory communication and a communication tool. Moreover, signallers' use of their right hand was more important for subordinates. This was also true in negative contexts for gestures common to most of the subjects. Our results further support the hypothesis that laterality in gestural communication might represent a precursor of the left-hemispheric lateralization of language. We discuss our results in relation to theories concerning the origins of cerebral hemispheric lateralization and their consistency with previous studies.

22444942;pi067;Animal pointing: Changing trends and findings from 30 years of research;"Krause M; Udell M; Leavens D; Skopos L";Journal Article;The past 30 years have witnessed a continued and growing interest in the production and comprehension of manual pointing gestures in nonhuman animals. Captive primates with diverse rearing histories have shown evidence of both pointing production and comprehension, though there certainly are individual and species differences, as well as substantive critiques of how to interpret pointing or 'pointing-like' gestures in animals. Early literature primarily addressed basic questions about whether captive apes point, understand pointing, and use the gesture in a way that communicates intent (declarative) rather than motivational states (imperative). Interest in these questions continues, but more recently there has been a dramatic increase in the number of articles examining pointing in a diverse array of species, with an especially large literature on canids. This proliferation of research on pointing and the diversification of species studied has brought new and exciting questions about the evolution of social cognition, and the effects of rearing history and domestication on pointing production and, more prolifically, comprehension. A review of this work is in order. In this article, we examine trends in the literature on pointing in nonhumans. Specifically, we examine publication frequencies of different study species from 1987 to 2016. We also review data on the form and function of pointing, and evidence either supporting or refuting the conclusion that various nonhuman species comprehend the meaning of pointing gestures.

22445134;pi068;Captive chimpanzees use their right hand to communicate with each other: Implications for the origin of the cerebral substrate for language;"Meguerditchian A; Vauclair J; Hopkins W";Journal Article;Whether precursors of the left-lateralization for human language can be found in the vocal and gestural communication systems of nonhuman primates remains a topic of intense research, particularly within theoretical discussions of the evolutionary origins of language. Although previous studies in chimpanzees have reported evidence of right-handedness for inter-species food-beg gestures produced exclusively toward humans, some might question the generality of these results to intra-species communicative signals. To address this issue, we recorded hand use in 70 captive chimpanzees for species-typical signals, that could be directed either toward conspecifics or humans. We found evidence of a predominance of right-handedness for species-typical gestures in captive chimpanzees when directed to both humans and conspecifics. Hand preferences during intra-species communication were significantly and positively correlated with gestures directed toward humans. By contrast, hand preferences for gestures did not significantly correlate with hand use for a non-communicative self-directed action. The collective results suggest (a) that evidence of predominance of right-handedness for human-directed gestures communication is not specific to this context and (b) the existence of a specific communicative system involving gestures constitutes an ideal prerequisite for the cerebral substrates of human language and its typical left-lateralization.

23080883;pi069;Group size, communication, and familiarity effects in foraging human teams;"Oesch N; Dunbar R I M";Journal Article;Exploitation of food resources that are dispersed in time and space has been crucial to the evolutionary success of humans. Recent experimental work has shown that an absence of communication impairs decision_making in a foraging task. Here, we found that individuals in larger teams were more likely to reach group consensus and were more accurate and efficient foragers. Individuals in larger teams were also more likely to gesture to one another, while levels of verbal exchange were not significantly different in small and large groups. At last, teams in which individuals reported that they knew one another and rated team members as helpful and information_seeking were more accurate in their foraging. Overall, our findings offer experimental evidence that larger, communicating, familiar teams are quicker and more accurate foragers. We therefore suggest that complex communication within socially bonded relationships may have been important to the ecological success of the human lineage.

22445658;pi070;What is a gesture? A meaning-based approach to defining gestural repertoires;"Hobaiter C; Byrne R";Journal Article;"Current systems of categorising ape gestures are typically subjective, relying on human intuition. We have systematised the features on which categorization depends (movement; body part; one/both limbs; use of detached object; rhythmic repetition; contact with recipient), showing that a potential repertoire of over 1000 gestures is physically possible, as large as the lexicon of some languages. In contrast, little more than a tenth of these gestures is used in chimpanzee communication. The striking overlaps in repertoire found between populations and even species of great ape are evidently not a result of a restricted set of possible gestures. Using the reactions of signallers to identify which gestures are intended to be different by the apes themselves, we revised the current classification, making some new distinctions and abolishing others previously considered important, giving a final repertoire of 81. A small number of gestures are used deictically, such that the recipient must pay attention to specific locations to satisfy the signaller; raising the possibility of a stepping-stone to the evolution of reference.

The present study sheds new light on this process by tracking the development of anticipatory vowel-to-vowel coarticulation in a cross-sectional investigation of 62 German children (from 3.5 to 7 years of age) and 13 adults. It focuses on gestures of the tongue, a complex organ whose spatiotemporal control is indispensable for speech production. The goal of the study was threefold: 1) investigate whether children as well as adults initiate the articulation for a target vowel in advance of its acoustic onset, 2) test if the identity of the intervocalic consonant matters and finally, 3) describe age-related developments of these lingual coarticulatory patterns. To achieve this goal, ultrasound tongue imaging was used to record lingual movements and quantify changes in coarticulation degree as a function of consonantal context and age. Results from linear mixed effects models indicate that like adults, children initiate vowels' lingual gestures well ahead of their acoustic onset. Second, while the identity of the intervocalic consonant affects the degree of vocalic anticipation in adults, it does not in children at any age. Finally, the degree of vowel-to-vowel coarticulation is significantly higher in all cohorts of children than in adults. However, among children, a developmental decrease of vocalic coarticulation is only found for sequences including the alveolar stop /d/ which requires finer spatiotemporal coordination of the tongue's subparts compared to labial and velar stops. Altogether, results suggest greater gestural overlap in child than in adult speech and support the view of a non-uniform and protracted maturation of lingual coarticulation calling for thorough considerations of the articulatory intricacies from which subtle developmental differences may originate.

The study�s subjects were 11 WS individuals and 22 typically-developing controls who performed a narrative task. We analyzed offline gesture production and its relation with language and spatial information. Compared to the control groups, WS individuals produced more representational gestures that anticipated, supplemented, or gesture-only communication. Gestures produced by WS participants serve a compensatory role particularly in representing spatial contents.

These facts make the study of ape gesture directly relevant to understanding the evolutionary precursors of human language; here we present an assessment of ape gesture from that perspective, focusing on the work of the 'St Andrews Group' of researchers. Intended meanings of ape gestures are relatively few and simple. As with human words, ape gestures often have several distinct meanings, which are effectively disambiguated by behavioural context. Compared to the signalling of most other animals, great ape gestural repertoires are large. Because of this, and the relatively small number of intended meanings they achieve, ape gestures are redundant, with extensive overlaps in meaning. The great majority of gestures are innate, in the sense that the species� biological inheritance includes the potential to develop each gestural form and use it for a specific range of purposes. Moreover, the phylogenetic origin of many gestures is relatively old, since gestures are extensively shared between different genera in the great ape family. Acquisition of an adult repertoire is a process of first exploring the innate species potential for many gestures and then gradual restriction to a final (active) repertoire that is much smaller. No evidence of syntactic structure has yet been detected.

There are well-defined cortical regions involved in both the comprehension and production of speech including Wernicke's and Broca's area. To what extent these regions play a role in the communicative abilities of primates, notably great apes, remains a central topic of research in neuroscience, anthropology, and psychology. In this chapter, I present an overview of the cognitive foundations of gestural and vocal communication in chimpanzees, including some results from language-trained apes. I also present data on the evolution in size and lateralization of Wernicke's and Broca's area in chimpanzees. These anatomical data are combined with behavioral data to show how individual differences in gestural and vocal communication are associated with volumetric and lateralized differences in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. The collective findings are discussed within the context of language evolution and the emergence of complex motor and cognitive processes in humans after the split from the common ancestor with chimpanzees.

There are other dimensions to the process, but our proposal is that the gestures of early humans were closer to symbolic communication in terms of the social, cognitive, and learning processes involved, and so they were a very likely starting point on the human road to symbols and language.

22444940;pi078;Reflections on the differential organization of mirror neuron systems for hand and mouth and their role in the evolution of communication in primates;"Coudé G; Ferrari P";Journal Article;"It is now generally accepted that the motor system is not purely dedicated to the control of behavior, but also has cognitive functions. Mirror neurons have provided a new perspective on how sensory information regarding others� actions and gestures is coupled with the internal cortical motor representation of them. This coupling allows an individual to enrich his interpretation of the social world through the activation of his own motor representations. Such mechanisms have been highly preserved in evolution as they are present in humans, apes and monkeys. Recent neuroanatomical data showed that there are two different connectivity patterns in mirror neuron networks in the macaque: one is concerned with sensorimotor transformation in relation to reaching and hand grasping within the traditional parietal-premotor circuits; the second one is linked to the mouth/face motor control and the new data show that it is connected with limbic structures. The mouth mirror sector seems to be wired not only for ingestive behaviors but also for orofacial communicative gestures and vocalizations. Notably, the hand and mouth mirror networks partially overlap, suggesting the importance of hand-mouth synergies not only for sensorimotor transformation, but also for communicative purposes in order to better convey and control social signals.

23080820;pi079;The emergence of systematicity: How environmental and communicative factors shape a novel communication system;"Nolle J; Staib M; Fusaroli R; Tylén K";Journal Article;Where does linguistic structure come from? We suggest that systematicity in language evolves adaptively in response to environmental and contextual affordances associated with the practice of communication itself. In two experiments, we used a silent gesture referential game paradigm to investigate environmental and social factors promoting the propagation of systematicity in a novel communication system. We found that structure in the emerging communication systems evolve contingent on structural properties of the environment. More specifically, interlocutors spontaneously relied on structural features of the referent stimuli they communicated about to motivate systematic aspects of the evolving communication system even when idiosyncratic iconic strategies were equally afforded. Furthermore, we found systematicity to be promoted by the nature of the referent environment. When the referent environment was open and unstable, analytic systematic strategies were more likely to emerge compared to stimulus environments with a closed set of referents. Lastly, we found that displacement of communication promoted systematicity. That is, when interlocutors had to communicate about items not immediately present in the moment of communication, they were more likely to evolve systematic solutions, supposedly due to working memory advantages. Together, our findings provide experimental evidence for the idea that linguistic structure evolves adaptively from contextually situated language use.

In captive baboons, population-level right-handedness has been reported for both coordinated bimanual actions and communicative gestures. However, some authors remain skeptical of these findings on both methodological and theoretical grounds. Here, we demonstrated the robustness and the consistency across time of the pattern of right-handedness for a species-specific communicative gesture in olive baboons (Papio anubis). First, we showed significant correlations in the 26 retested baboons for the measures of hand preferences between the first and the second session conducted 4 years later (2005�2009) by an observer blind to the previous handedness data. Second, the replication of the study in 96 novel individuals revealed a similar degree of population-level right-handedness than the one expressed in the first group of 66 subjects investigated in 2005. The implications of the findings are discussed within a theoretical framework about the origin of hemispheric specialization for language.

22445179;pi086;Communication in nonhuman primates;Zuberbuhler K;Book Chapter;Three major evolutionary trends are visible in primate communication. The first one has to do with the basic signal production mechanisms being increasingly controlled by complex cognition. This is evident by audience effects with gestural and vocal signals and by context-specific call sequences. The second transition has to do with increased control over signal morphology, a feature somewhat visible in ape vocal and gestural communication and particularly human language. The third transition is apparent in signal-processing mechanisms, which are increasingly based on learned world facts, rather than mere stimulus-response conditioning. Human communication appears to differ only gradually from other primates in these domains, apart from a highly cooperative social motivation, which influences human communication in profound ways.

22445628;pi089;Meaning, intention, and inference in primate vocal communication;"Fischer J; Price T";Journal Article;Two core questions in the study of speech evolution are whether nonhuman primate signals should be conceived as referential, and what the role of social cognition is in primate communication. Current evidence suggests that the structure of primate vocalizations is largely innate and related to the affective/motivational state of the caller, with a probabilistic and underdetermined relationship between specific events and calls. Moreover, nonhuman primates do not appear to express or comprehend communicative or informative intent, which is in line with a lack of mental state attribution to others. We argue that nonhuman primate vocalizations as well as gestures should be best conceived as goal-directed, where signallers are sensitive to the relation between their signalling and receivers� responses. Receivers in turn use signals to predict signaller behaviour. In combination with their ability to integrate information from multiple sources, this renders the system as a whole relatively powerful, despite the lack of higher-order intentionality on the side of sender or receiver.

In particular, I will focus on two meaning schemas that are associated with hand-opening articulations. Using lexicographical data, I will confirm that they are present in two sign languages with no apparent connection, such as Spanish Sign Language (LSE) and British Sign Language (BSL). Obvious similarities are perceived in some of the lexemes, which are also expressed through similar articulatory means. In the case of LSE, the language from which my analysis stems, I will also have the opportunity to verify the existence of both metaphors as early as the nineteenth century since they are registered in the Fern�ndez Villabrille dictionary (1851).

Written in the mid- 1960s, his Gesture and Speech offers a vivid contrast to Chomsky's contemporary mentalist view of language that espoused Cartesian rationalism with its barriers between man and beast, and between body and mind. On the contrary, Leroi-Gourhan takes an integrated approach to human evolution: gesture (conceived of as 'material action') and speech are seen as twin products of an embodied mind that engendered our technical and social achievements. His explanation of the evolutionary association between the hand and the face provides a biological basis for cognitive as well as communicational aspects of gesture, with culture emerging as an extension of our zoological foundation. He asserts that the liberating of the hand from locomotion led to the liberating of the face from prehension, thus creating the duality of instrument and symbol whereby human beings physically and mentally grasp the world in which they live.

22445615;pi092;Intraspecific gestural laterality in chimpanzees and gorillas and the impact of social propensities;"Prieur J; Pika S; Barbu S; Blois-Heulin C";Journal Article;A relevant approach to address the mechanisms underlying the emergence of the right-handedness/left-hemisphere language specialization of humans is to investigate both proximal and distal causes of language lateralization through the study of non-human primates� gestural laterality. We carried out the first systematic, quantitative comparison of within-subjects� and between-species� laterality by focusing on the laterality of intraspecific gestures of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) living in six different captive groups. We addressed the following two questions: (1) Do chimpanzees and gorillas exhibit stable direction of laterality when producing different types of gestures at the individual level? If yes, is it related to the strength of laterality? (2) Is there a species difference in gestural laterality at the population level? If yes, which factors could explain this difference? During 1356 observation hours, we recorded 42335 cases of dyadic gesture use in the six groups totalling 39 chimpanzees and 35 gorillas. Results showed that both species could exhibit either stability or flexibility in their direction of gestural laterality. These results suggest that both stability and flexibility may have differently modulated the strength of laterality depending on the species social structure and dynamics. Furthermore, a multifactorial analysis indicates that these particular social components may have specifically impacted gestural laterality through the influence of gesture sensory modality and the position of the recipient in the signaller�s visual field during interaction. Our findings provide further support to the social theory of laterality origins proposing that social pressures may have shaped laterality through natural selection.

22445558;pi093;Linear grammar as a possible stepping-stone in the evolution of language;"Jackendoff R; Wittenberg E";Journal Article;We suggest that one way to approach the evolution of language is through reverse engineering: asking what components of the language faculty could have been useful in the absence of the full complement of components. We explore the possibilities offered by linear grammar, a form of language that lacks syntax and morphology altogether, and that structures its utterances through a direct mapping between semantics and phonology. A language with a linear grammar would have no syntactic categories or syntactic phrases, and therefore no syntactic recursion. It would also have no functional categories such as tense, agreement, and case inflection, and no derivational morphology. Such a language would still be capable of conveying certain semantic relations through word order�for instance by stipulating that agents should precede patients. However, many other semantic relations would have to be based on pragmatics and discourse context. We find evidence of linear grammar in a wide range of linguistic phenomena: pidgins, stages of late second language acquisition, home signs, village sign languages, language comprehension (even in fully syntactic languages), aphasia, and specific language impairment. We also find a full-blown language, Riau Indonesian, whose grammar is arguably close to a pure linear grammar. In addition, when subjects are asked to convey information through nonlinguistic gesture, their gestures make use of semantically based principles of linear ordering. Finally, some pockets of English grammar, notably compounds, can be characterized in terms of linear grammar. We conclude that linear grammar is a plausible evolutionary precursor of modern fully syntactic grammar, one that is still active in the human mind.

23080859;pi096;Slip of the tongue: Implications for evolution and language development;"Forrester G; Rodriguez  A";Journal Article;A prevailing theory regarding the evolution of language implicates a gestural stage prior to the emergence of speech. In support of a transition of human language from a gestural to a vocal system, articulation of the hands and the tongue are underpinned by overlapping left hemisphere dominant neural regions. Behavioral studies demonstrate that human adults perform sympathetic mouth actions in imitative synchrony with manual actions. Additionally, right-handedness for precision manual actions in children has been correlated with the typical development of language, while a lack of hand bias has been associated with psychopathology. It therefore stands to reason that sympathetic mouth actions during fine precision motor action of the hands may be lateralized. We employed a fine-grained behavioral coding paradigm to provide the first investigation of tongue protrusions in typically developing 4-year old children. Tongue protrusions were investigated across a range of cognitive tasks that required varying degrees of manual action: precision motor action, gross motor action and no motor actions. The rate of tongue protrusions was influenced by the motor requirements of the task and tongue protrusions were significantly right-biased for only precision manual motor action (p < .001). From an evolutionary perspective, tongue protrusions can drive new investigations regarding how an early human communication system transitioned from hand to mouth. From a developmental perspective, the present study may serve to reveal patterns of tongue protrusions during the motor development of typically developing children.

22445405;pi097;Advantages of comparative studies in songbirds to understand the neural basis of sensorimotor integration;"Murphy K; James L S; Sakata J T; Prather J F ";Journal Article;Sensorimotor integration is the process through which the nervous system creates a link between motor commands and associated sensory feedback. This process allows for the acquisition and refinement of many behaviors, including learned communication behaviors such as speech and birdsong. Consequently, it is important to understand fundamental mechanisms of sensorimotor integration, and comparative analyses of this process can provide vital insight. Songbirds offer a powerful comparative model system to study how the nervous system links motor and sensory information for learning and control. This is because the acquisition, maintenance, and control of birdsong critically depend on sensory feedback. Furthermore, there is an incredible diversity of song organizations across songbird species, ranging from songs with simple, stereotyped sequences to songs with complex sequencing of vocal gestures, as well as a wide diversity of song repertoire sizes. Despite this diversity, the neural circuitry for song learning, control, and maintenance remains highly similar across species. Here, we highlight the utility of songbirds for the analysis of sensorimotor integration and the insights about mechanisms of sensorimotor integration gained by comparing different songbird species. Key conclusions from this comparative analysis are that variation in song sequence complexity seems to covary with the strength of feedback signals in sensorimotor circuits and that sensorimotor circuits contain distinct representations of elements in the vocal repertoire, possibly enabling evolutionary variation in repertoire sizes. We conclude our review by highlighting important areas of research that could benefit from increased comparative focus, with particular emphasis on the integration of new technologies.

22445149;pi099;The linguistic roots of natural pedagogy;"Mattos O; Hinzen W";Journal Article;Natural pedagogy is a human-specific capacity that allows us to acquire cultural information from communication even before the emergence of the first words, encompassing three core elements: (i) a sensitivity to ostensive signals like eye contact that indicate to infants that they are being addressed through communication, (ii) a subsequent referential expectation (satisfied by the use of declarative gestures) and (iii) a biased interpretation of ostensive-referential communication as conveying relevant information about the referent�s kind (Csibra and Gergely, 2006, 2009, 2011). Remarkably, the link between natural pedagogy and another human-specific capacity, namely language, has rarely been investigated in detail. We here argue that children�s production and comprehension of declarative gestures around 10 months of age are in fact expressions of an evolving faculty of language. Through both declarative gestures and ostensive signals, infants can assign the roles of third,second, and first person, building the �deictic space� that grounds both natural pedagogy and language use. Secondly, we argue that the emergence of two kinds of linguistic structures (i.e., proto-determiner phrases and proto-sentences) in the one-word period sheds light on the different kinds of information that children can acquire or convey at different stages of development (namely, generic knowledge about kinds and knowledge about particular events/actions/state of affairs, respectively). Furthermore, the development of nominal and temporal reference in speech allows children to cognize information in terms of spatial and temporal relations. In this way, natural pedagogy transpires as an inherent aspect of our faculty of language, rather than as an independent adaptation that predates language in evolution or development (Csibra and Gergely, 2006). This hypothesis is further testable through predictions it makes on the different linguistic profiles of toddlers with developmental disorders.

22445523;pi101;Tool-use-associated sound in the evolution of language;Larsson M;Journal Article;Proponents of the motor theory of language evolution have primarily focused on the visual domain and communication through observation of movements. In the present paper, it is hypothesized that the production and perception of sound, particularly of incidental sound of locomotion (ISOL) and tool-use sound (TUS), also contributed. Human bipedalism resulted in rhythmic and more predictable ISOL. It has been proposed that this stimulated the evolution of musical abilities, auditory working memory, and abilities to produce complex vocalizations and to mimic natural sounds. Since the human brain proficiently extracts information about objects and events from the sounds they produce, TUS, and mimicry of TUS, might have achieved an iconic function. The prevalence of sound symbolism in many extant languages supports this idea. Self-produced TUS activates multimodal brain processing (motor neurons, hearing, proprioception, touch, vision), and TUS stimulates primate audiovisual mirror neurons, which is likely to stimulate the development of association chains. Tool use and auditory gestures involve motor processing of the forelimbs, which is associated with the evolution of vertebrate vocal communication. The production, perception, and mimicry of TUS may have resulted in a limited number of vocalizations or protowords that were associated with tool use. A new way to communicate about tools, especially when out of sight, would have had selective advantage.

22445298;pi102;Performance of South African children on the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales�Developmental Profile (CSBS DP);"Chambers N; Stronach S; Wetherby A";Journal Article;"Background: Substantial development in social communication skills occurs in the first two years of life. Growth should be evident in sharing emotion and eye gaze; rate of communication, communicating for a variety of functions; using gestures, sounds and words; understanding language, and using functional and pretend actions with objects in play. A delay in these early social communication skills may be the first sign of a developmental delay in young children in nearly all categories of disabilities�including specific language impairment, autism spectrum disorder, HIV/AIDS, lack of environmental stimulation or institutionalization, and global developmental delays�and early detection of these delays is critical for enrolment in appropriate early intervention services. Aims: No standardized tests of early social communication skills exist for very young children in South Africa (SA). An existing evaluation tool that has the potential to be culturally fair for children from cultural backgrounds different to the standardization group is the Communication and Symbolic Behaviour Scales�Developmental Profile (CSBS DP). This study aimed to document the performance of a group of English_speaking SA children ranging in age from 12 to 24 months on the CSBS DP and to compare this performance with the original standardization sample. Methods & Procedures: Sixty_seven English_speaking SA children from a range of cultural and linguistic backgrounds were assessed on the CSBS DP Behaviour Sample. Group scores were compared with the original standardization sample using inferential statistics. Outcomes & Results: The results provide preliminary support for the suitability and validity of the face_to_face Behaviour Sample as a measure of early social communication skills in this sample of English_speaking SA children from a range of cultural groups between 12 and 24 months of age. Conclusions & Implications: While further research in the SA population is needed, these findings are a first step towards validating a culturally appropriate measure for early detection of social communication delays in a sample of SA toddlers.

22445666;pi103;Gestures and multimodal communication: Developmental and pathological aspects;Guidetti M;Book Chapter;In this chapter, we look at how three theoretical strands have been woven together. Originally developed by Jerome Bruner, the first of these theories, which Michael Tomasello (1999) later dubbed �cultural cognition�, can be summed up in the following quotation: �These were merely morphological steps that would not have mattered save for the concurrent emergence of symbolic systems, of traditionalized ways of living and working together, in short a human culture�. It was this cultural cognition that allowed humans to acquire and develop communication, in the form of both gestures and language. The second theory adopts an evolutionary perspective, seeing our behaviour as the product of the history of the human species.

22444814;pi104;So how does gesture function in speaking, communication, and thinking?;"Church R B; Goldin-Meadow S";Book Chapter;This concluding chapter reflects on the book's collected works that encapsulate, in the Aristotelian sense, gesture's efficient causes (i.e., mechanisms that stimulate gesture) and its final causes (i.e., purposes that gesture serves). We conclude that gesture is multifunctional operating on all levels of analysis (biological, psychological, and social levels), in all time frames (moment-to-moment, ontogenetic, and evolutionary time) and under many different discourse requirements. One over-arching theme emerges. Gesture functions simultaneously for both its producers and its observers, and thus provides a dual function that shapes thinking and language in the producer, which, in turn, shapes thinking and language in the observer�a process that underlies how we share ideas and create community.

22445406;pi105;Deaf gain in evolutionary perspective;Armstrong D;Book Chapter;"One approach to assessing Deaf Gain is to ask what the Deaf experience has contributed to the sum total of human knowledge. That is, what benefit has the Deaf experience conferred on humanity in general, as opposed to deaf people in particular? This chapter will approach the question from the perspective of human evolution, and it will follow two separate but ultimately related threads. The first thread is probably familiar to most readers of this book; it concerns the contribution that study of human signed languages has made to the study of human evolution in general and the evolution of the human capacity for language in particular. Study of the linguistic structure of signed languages that was begun in the 1950s by William C. Stokoe and others has made a major contribution to the much more ancient gestural theory of language origins, and consideration of the history of that theory comprises the next part of this chapter. The second thread, introduced in the final section of the chapter, is of somewhat more recent origin and addresses particularly what can be learned from the application of principles of cultural evolution to the study of the visual communication of Deaf people. In particular, it can be assumed that as their signed languages develop over time. Deaf people introduce features that tend to make optimal use of the human capacity for visual communication.

22445290;pi106;Tonkean macaques communicate with their right hand;"Meunier H; Fizet J; Vauclair J";Journal Article;There are two conflicting hypotheses to explain the origins of language. Vocal origin theory states that language results from the gradual evolution of animals� vocal communication, but gestural origin theory considers that language evolved from gestures, with the initial left-hemispheric control of manual gestures gradually encompassing vocalizations. To contribute to this debate, we investigated functional hemispheric specialization related to hand biases when grasping or showing an object through manual gesture in Tonkean macaques. The results of this study, the first quantitative study on Tonkean macaques� handedness, showed a remarkable convergence of the Tonkean macaques� handedness patterns with those of baboons and human infants, with hand preferences for manual communicative gestures significantly favoring the use of the right hand. Our findings support the hypothesis that left hemispheric lateralization for language is derived from a gestural communication system that was present in the common ancestor of macaques, baboons and humans.

22445414;pi107;The Moro reaction: More than a reflex, a ritualized behavior of nonverbal communication;"Rousseau P; Matton F; Lecuyer R; Lahaye W";Journal Article;Objective: To propose a phylogenetic significance to the Moro reflex which remains unexplained since its publication in 1918 because both hands are free at the end of the gesture. Method: Among the 75 videos of healthy term newborns we have filmed in a research project on antenatal education to parenthood, we describe a sequence that clearly showed the successive movements of the Moro reflex and we report the occurrence of this reflex in the videos that were recorded from Time 0 of birth defined as the moment that lies between the birth of the thorax and the pelvis of the infant. Results: The selected sequence showed the following succession of the newborn�s actions: quick extension-adduction of both arms, the orientation of the body, head and eyes towards a human person, and full extension-abduction of both arms with spreading of the fingers, crying and a distressed face. There were 13 Moro reflexes between 2 and 14s from Time 0 of birth. We found a significant association between the occurrence of the Moro reflex and the placement of the newborn at birth in supine position on the mother�s abdomen (p = 0.002). Discussion: The quick extension-adduction of both arms which started the sequence may be considered as a startle reflex controlled by the neural fear system and the arm extension-adduction which followed as a Moro reflex. The characteristics of all Moro reflexes were those of ritualization: amplitude, duration, stereotype of the gestures. This evolutionary process turns a physiological behavior, grasping in this case, to a non-verbal communicative behavior whose meaning is a request to be picked up in the arms. The gestures associated with the Moro reflex: crying and orientation of the body, head, and eyes towards a human person, are gestures of intention to communicate which support our hypothesis. The neural mechanism of the Moro reaction probably involves both the fear and the separation-distress systems. Conclusion: This paper proposes for the first time a phylogenetic significance to the Moro reflex: a ritualized behavior of nonverbal communication. Professionals should avoid stimulating the newborns� fear system by unnecessarily triggering Moro reflexes. Antenatal education should teach parents to respond to the Moro reflexes of their newborn infant by picking her up in their arms with mother talk.

22444884;pi108;Speech, stone tool-making and the evolution of language;"Cataldo D M; Migliano A B; Vinicius L";Journal Article;"The 'technological hypothesis' proposes that gestural language evolved in early hominins to enable the cultural transmission of stone tool-making skills, with speech appearing later in response to the complex lithic industries of more recent hominins. However, no flintknapping study has assessed the efficiency of speech alone (unassisted by gesture) as a tool-making transmission aid. Here we show that subjects instructed by speech alone underperform in stone tool-making experiments in comparison to subjects instructed through either gesture alone or `full language' (gesture plus speech), and also report lower satisfaction with their received instruction. The results provide evidence that gesture was likely to be selected over speech as a teaching aid in the earliest hominin tool-makers; that speech could not have replaced gesturing as a tool-making teaching aid in later hominins, possibly explaining the functional retention of gesturing in the full language of modern humans; and that speech may have evolved for reasons unrelated to tool-making. We conclude that speech is unlikely to have evolved as tool-making teaching aid superior to gesture, as claimed by the technological hypothesis, and therefore alternative views should be considered. For example, gestural language may have evolved to enable tool-making in earlier hominins, while speech may have later emerged as a response to increased trade and more complex inter- and intra-group interactions in Middle Pleistocene ancestors of Neanderthals and Homo sapiens; or gesture and speech may have evolved in parallel rather than in sequence.

22445126;pi109;Ontogenetic ritualization of primate gesture as a case study in dyadic brain modeling;"Gasser B; Cartmill E; Arbib M";Journal Article;This paper introduces dyadic brain modeling � the simultaneous, computational modeling of the brains of two interacting agents � to explore ways in which our understanding of macaque brain circuitry can ground new models of brain mechanisms involved in ape interaction. Specifically, we assess a range of data on gestural communication of great apes as the basis for developing an account of the interactions of two primates engaged in ontogenetic ritualization, a proposed learning mechanism through which a functional action may become a communicative gesture over repeated interactions between two individuals (the �dyad�). The integration of behavioral, neural, and computational data in dyadic (or, more generally, social) brain modeling has broad application to comparative and evolutionary questions, particularly for the evolutionary origins of cognition and language in the human lineage. We relate this work to the neuroinformatics challenges of integrating and sharing data to support collaboration between primatologists, neuroscientists and modelers that will help speed the emergence of what may be called comparative neuro-primatology.

22445626;pi110;From grasping to grooming to gossip: Innovative use of chimpanzee signals in novel environments supports both vocal and gestural theories of language origins;"Leavens D A; Taglialatela J P; Hopkins W D";Book Chapter;The unique challenges posed by ecologically novel situations can illuminate the limits of flexibility in animal signalling systems. Here we describe the innovative application of species-typical calls by chimpanzees exposed to the novel circumstances in which the animals are dependent upon others to act on the world for them, what we have previously termed 'the Referential Problem Space'. When chimpanzees are put into the Referential Problem Space, they display attention-getting calls and other auditory signals, and they tailor these signals to the state of attention of the receiver. Here we report that the kinds of calls that chimpanzees use in these evolutionarily novel circumstances are, generally, amplified versions of the same calls that they display in grooming contexts. Thus, this class of auditory signals, used in affiliative, grooming contexts, is chosen overwhelmingly by chimpanzees for application towards novel ends. This is consistent with Dunbar's (Grooming, gossip and the evolution of language. Faber and Faber, London, 1996) hypothesis that early humans substituted auditory contact for manual grooming as group sizes exceeded ca. 150 people. Moreover, these calls are primarily produced by supralaryngeal modulation of die airstream. This is consistent with Corballis's (From hand to mouth: The origins of language. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2002) hypothesis that intentional communication in humans moved from the hands to the mouth and then into the larynx. In contemporary chimpanzees, we find intentional modulation of calls focused at the fronts of their oral cavities, for most grooming calls.

In a GP gesture and speech are inherent and equal parts. Out of a GP comes speech orchestrated around a gesture. Can theories of language origin explain this dynamic process?

A new theory, called Mead's Loop, is proposed that meets the test. Mead's Loop agrees that gesture was indispensable to the origin of language but holds that gesture was not first, that any gesture-first could not have led to language, and that to reach it gesture and speech had to be 'equiprimordial.'

22445590;pi112;Does dysfunction of the mirror neuron system contribute to symptoms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?;"Eisen A; Lemon  R; Kiernan M C; Hornberger M; Turner  M R";Journal Article;There is growing evidence that mirror neurons, initially discovered over two decades ago in the monkey, are present in the human brain. In the monkey, mirror neurons characteristically fire not only when it is performing an action, such as grasping an object, but also when observing a similar action performed by another agent (human or monkey). In this review we discuss the origin, cortical distribution and possible functions of mirror neurons as a background to exploring their potential relevance in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We have recently proposed that ALS (and the related condition of frontotemporal dementia) may be viewed as a failure of interlinked functional complexes having their origins in key evolutionary adaptations. This can include loss of the direct projections from the corticospinal tract, and this is at least part of the explanation for impaired motor control in ALS. Since, in the monkey, corticospinal neurons also show mirror properties, ALS in humans might also affect the mirror neuron system. We speculate that a defective mirror neuron system might contribute to other ALS deficits affecting motor imagery, gesture, language and empathy.

22445618;pi113;Bodily mimesis and the transition to speech;Zlatev J;Book Chapter;The chapter reviews evidence for the bodily mimesis hypothesis, which states that the evolution of language was preceded by an adaptation for improved volitional control of the body, giving our ancestors advantages in the domains of imitation, empathy, and gestural communication. Much of this evidence is also shared by other gesture-first theories of language origins, but they face the problem of explaining the 'switch' from a gestural (proto) language to a spoken one. The bodily mimesis hypothesis fares better with this objection, since it (a) emphasizes the nonconventionality and non-systematicity of bodily mimetic signaling, (b) posits a long biocultural spiral of conventionalization and adaptation for speech, and (c) insists that the transition to speech should be seen as only partial. Following Brown (2012), a cognitive-semiotic explanation can further be given as to why speech has eventually taken on increasingly higher communicative load: Vocalization is intrinsically less capable of iconic representation, and given a multimodal gestural-vocal communicative signal, the vocal element is bound to eventually take on the role of symbolic representation, involving higher levels of conventionality and systematicity.

The exchange began as a series of questions on the synchronicity of gesture and speech in the Growth Point (GP). This led to some basic questions on the GP itself and Mead's Loop. The GP is created through the translation of our experiences (embodiment) as a combination of gesture and speech that allow us to capture, describe and transmit those experiences as thoughts.

22445001;pi115;Social brain hypothesis: Vocal and gesture networks of wild chimpanzees;"Roberts S; Roberts A";Journal Article;A key driver of brain evolution in primates and humans is the cognitive demands arising from managing social relationships. In primates, grooming plays a key role in maintaining these relationships, but the time that can be devoted to grooming is inherently limited. Communication may act as an additional, more time-efficient bonding mechanism to grooming, but how patterns of communication are related to patterns of sociality is still poorly understood. We used social network analysis to examine the associations between close proximity (duration of time spent within 10m per hour spent in the same party), grooming, vocal communication, and gestural communication (duration of time and frequency of behavior per hour spent within 10 m) in wild chimpanzees. This study examined hypotheses formulated a priori and the results were not corrected for multiple testing. Chimpanzees had differentiated social relationships, with focal chimpanzees maintaining some level of proximity to almost all group members, but directing gestures at and grooming with a smaller number of preferred social partners. Pairs of chimpanzees that had high levels of close proximity had higher rates of grooming. Importantly, higher rates of gestural communication were also positively associated with levels of proximity, and specifically gestures associated with affiliation (greeting, gesture to mutually groom) were related to proximity. Synchronized low-intensity pant-hoots were also positively related to proximity in pairs of chimpanzees. Further, there were differences in the size of individual chimpanzees� proximity networks�the number of social relationships they maintained with others. Focal chimpanzees with larger proximity networks had a higher rate of both synchronized low- intensity pant-hoots and synchronized high-intensity pant-hoots. These results suggest that in addition to grooming, both gestures and synchronized vocalizations may play key roles in allowing chimpanzees to manage a large and differentiated set of social relationships. Gestures may be important in reducing the aggression arising from being in close proximity to others, allowing for proximity to be maintained for longer and facilitating grooming. Vocalizations may allow chimpanzees to communicate with a larger number of recipients than gestures and the synchronized nature of the pant-hoot calls may facilitate social bonding of more numerous social relationships. As group sizes increased through human evolution, both gestures and synchronized vocalizations may have played important roles in bonding social relationships in a more time-efficient manner than grooming.

In the original article, that an author, Claire D. Vallotton, was inadvertently omitted from the first published version of their manuscript. The revised authorship should be: Paula Mu�oz, Chamarrita Farkas, Claire D. Vallotton. The revised authorship list has since been corrected online.] Emotions and their expression are adaptive processes, relevant to maintaining personal welfare and to structuring social relations through the verbal and nonverbal communication of feelings and needs to others. Emotional representation refers to the ability to intentionally and deliberately produce facial and bodily movements to convey an emotion. Although this representation possesses universal aspects, its richness lies in its cultural variability. This study seeks to describe and compare the intensity of the facial and bodily representation of six emotions in 120 Chilean and American women from different socioeconomic groups. The study adopts an investigatory, descriptive, cross-sectional and comparative design. A socio-demographic questionnaire and an assessment of emotional gestures in adults were applied. For the assessment, the women�s responses to six short stories related to the emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, pride and shame were filmed and coded by independent coders from both countries. The results indicate that Chilean women are more intense when representing happiness and pride with their faces, whereas American women are more intense when representing happiness and anger with their bodies. In addition, differences emerge based on socioeconomic status. In both countries, a higher socioeconomic status is associated with greater intensity in the representation of emotions. The results and their implications are discussed.

22445201;pi117;Music and meaning: An evolutionary story;Tolbert E;Journal Article;The literature on the evolution of music is quite sparse, and the topic is often mentioned only in passing as part of larger proposals concerning the origin of language and the emergence of modem human cognitive abilities. Although music, no less than language, is a uniquely human behaviour, most evolutionary scenarios either do not mention music at all, or make ethnocentric assumptions concerning the nature of music and its relationship to language, assumptions that are at odds with findings in ethnomusicology concerning the social embeddedness and mutual interdependence of music and language across a wide range of socio-cultural contexts. This paper attempts to articulate an evolutionarily plausible and socially grounded theory of musical meaning in light of recent proposals concerning the origins of human cognitive abilities. Expanding upon Donald's (1991) suggestion that the capacity for representation evolved prior to the development of language, this paper proposes that music is grounded in a capacity for 'mimesis', or motor modelling, and has a social ontology rooted in gesture and preverbal spatio-temporal concepts. Although both music and language evolved from a mimetic capacity, musical meaning retains a distinct link to vocal mimesis through sonic representations of...

22445536;pi118;Formulating autism systemically: Part 2�A 12-year prospective case study;"Brewerton N; Robson K; Crittenden P M";Journal Article;This prospective case study illustrates the ideas on the developmental origins of some cases of autism that were described in Part 1 of this article. We explored and found support for several systemic hypotheses regarding the experience of �Graeme� and his mother. Graeme�s story is told prospectively from the age of 3 until 15. Three independent sources of information are reported: hypotheses from the literature and case review in Part 1 of this article, the school�s experience, and observations from the assessments of attachment when Graeme was turning 6. These three streams of information are integrated here. The review of the literature and clinical cases gives us a wide-angle lens, empirically supporting our focus on danger in relationships. The school�s experience describes working with a child with undiagnosed autism. The assessments of attachment both provide information about family members� psychological strategies for protection from danger and also include the mother�s childhood history of family threat. Their synthesis permits us to construct a developmental history, from Graeme�s mother�s childhood history of being triangulated into her parents� hidden marital discord to it�s repetition for Graeme in her own marriage. New observations included mum�s postural/gestural communication to Graeme and her possible ambivalence about males. Strikingly, Graeme was a case study (Attachment & Family Therapy, ch. 6) before he was diagnosed with autism. That presentation focused on Graeme�s feeling of rejection by his father. In the same book, an interpersonal formulation of autism was offered (ch. 3), but it was not connected to Graeme, showing that when one lacks crucial information, the clinical formulation is distorted. The crucial information in this case was the mother�s psychological history. Our case suggests that filling the blind spot in the research on autism with information about family functioning over at least two generations might change the understanding of autism in ways that could help families and their children.

22445183;pi121;From monkey-like action recognition to human language: An evolutionary framework for neurolinguistics;Arbib M A ;Journal Article;The article analyzes the neural and functional grounding of language skills as well as their emergence in hominid evolution, hypothesizing stages leading from abilities known to exist in monkeys and apes and presumed to exist in our hominid ancestors right through to modern spoken and signed languages. The starting point is the observation that both premotor area F5 in monkeys and Broca's area in humans contain a 'mirror system' active for both execution and observation of manual actions, and that F5 and Broca's area are homologous brain regions. This grounded the Mirror System Hypothesis of Rizzolatti & Arbib (1998) which offers the mirror system for grasping as a key neural 'missing link' between the abilities of our non-human ancestors of 20 million years ago and modern human language, with manual gestures rather than a system for vocal communication providing the initial seed for this evolutionary process. The present article, however, goes 'beyond the mirror' to offer hypotheses on evolutionary changes within and outside the mirror systems which may have occurred to equip Homo sapiens with a language-ready brain. Crucial to the early stages of this progression is the mirror system for grasping and its extension to permit imitation. Imitation is seen as evolving via a so-called 'simple' system such as that found in chimpanzees (which allows imitation of complex 'object-oriented' sequences but only as the result of extensive practice) to a so-called 'complex' system found in humans (which allows rapid imitation even of complex sequences, under appropriate conditions) which supports pantomime. This is hypothesized to provide the substrate for the development of protosign, a combinatorially open repertoire of manual gestures, which then provides the scaffolding for the emergence of protospeech (which thus owes little to non-human vocalizations), with protosign and protospeech then developing in an expanding spiral. It is argued that these stages involve biological evolution of both brain and body. By contrast, it is argued that the progression from protosign and protospeech to languages with full-blown syntax and compositional semantics was a historical phenomenon in the development of Homo sapiens, involving few if any further biological changes.

22444919;pi122;Considering the role of social dynamics and positional behavior in gestural communication research;"Smith L W; Delgado R A ";Journal Article;While the hominin fossil record cannot inform us on either the presence or extent of social and cognitive abilities that may have paved the way for the emergence of language, studying non_vocal communication among our closest living relatives, the African apes, may provide valuable information about how language originated. Although much has been learned from gestural signaling in non_human primates, we have not yet established how and why gestural repertoires vary across species, what factors influence this variation, and how knowledge of these differences can contribute to an understanding of gestural signaling�s contribution to language evolution. In this paper, we review arguments surrounding the theory that language evolved from gestural signaling and suggest some important factors to consider when conducting comparative studies of gestural communication among African apes. Specifically, we propose that social dynamics and positional behavior are critical components that shape the frequency and nature of gestural signaling across species and we argue that an understanding of these factors could shed light on how gestural communication may have been the basis of human language. We outline predictions for the influence of these factors on the frequencies and types of gestures used across the African apes and highlight the importance of including these factors in future gestural communication research with primates.

22445754;pi124;Tufted capuchins (Cebus apella) adapt their communicative behaviour to human's attentional states;"Defolie C; Malassis R; Serre M; Meunier H";Journal Article;Animal communication has become a widely studied field of research, especially because of the associated debates on the origin of human language. Due to their phylogenetic proximity with humans, non-human primates represent a suitable model to investigate the precursors of language. This study focuses on the perception of the attentional states of others, an important prerequisite to intentional communication. We investigated whether capuchins (Cebus apella) produce a learnt pointing gesture towards a hidden and unreachable food reward as a function of the attentional status of the human experimenter. For that purpose, we tested five subjects that we first trained to indicate by a pointing gesture towards the human partner the position of a reward hidden by an assistant. Then, capuchins were tested in two experimental conditions randomly ordered. In the first condition�motivation trial�the experimenter was attentive to the subject gestures and rewarded him immediately when it pointed towards the baited cylinder. During the second condition�test trial�the experimenter adopted one of the following attention states and the subject was rewarded after 10 s has elapsed, regardless of the subject�s behaviour. Five attentional states were tested: (1) experimenter absent, (2) experimenter back to the monkey, (3) experimenter�s head away, (4) experimenter watching above the monkey, and (5) experimenter watching the monkey face. Our results reveal a variation in our subjects� communicative behaviours with a discrimination of the different postural clues (body and head orientation) available in our experimental conditions. This study suggests that capuchins can flexibly use a communicative gesture to adapt to the attentional state of their partner and provides evidence that acquired communicative gestures of monkeys might be used intentionally.

Such centers, initially developed for tool construction and use, would have occupied an intermediate position in the evolutionary sequence. Thus, cortically driven facial gestures may have accompanied manual signing, modulating limbic vocalizations of affect, although a cortical-limbic distinction with respect to communication may be unwarranted.

22445220;pi130;A comparative assessment of handedness and its potential neuroanatomical correlates in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus);"Hopkins W; Schaeffer J; Russell J; Bogart S; Meguerditchian A; Coulon O";Journal Article;The evolutionary origins of human right-handedness remain poorly understood. Some have hypothesized that tool use served as an important preadaptation for the eventual evolution of population-level right-handedness. In contrast, others have suggested that complex gestural and vocal communication served as prerequisite for the evolution of human right-handedness. In this study, we tested these competing hypotheses by comparing the handedness of bonobos and chimpanzees, two closely related species of Pan, on three different measures of hand use including simple reaching, manual gestures and coordinated bimanual actions. Chimpanzees are well known for their tool using abilities whereas bonobos rarely use tools in the wild. In contrast, many have suggested that bonobos have a more flexible gestural and vocal communication system than chimpanzees. The overall results showed that chimpanzees were significantly more right-handed than bonobos for all three measures suggesting that adaptations for tool use rather than communication may have led to the emergence of human right-handedness. We further show that species differences in handedness may be linked to variation in the size and asymmetry of the motor-hand area of the precentral gyrus. The results are discussed within the context of evolutionary theories of handedness, as well as some limitations in the approach to handedness measurement in nonhuman primates.

Possible referential gesturing during allogrooming by wild bonnet macaques, Macaca radiata;"Gupta S; Sinha A";Journal Article;Intentional referential gestures, a fundamental building block of symbolic human language, have been reported from a range of species, including non-human primates. While apes are known to spontaneously use intentional gestures, only captive macaques, amongst non-ape primates, appear to intentionally display learnt gestures. On the other hand, referential gestures have so far been reported only in chimpanzees, amongst non-human primates. We document here, for the first time, potentially referential gesturing, used intentionally as well, in a monkey species, the bonnet macaque Macaca radiata, in the wild. Bonnet macaques use four distinct actions during allogrooming, possibly to indicate a particular body part intended to be groomed. These acts were successful in drawing the recipients� attention to the indicated part, which they began to groom subsequently. This study enriches our understanding of non-ape primate gestural communication and adds to the growing evidence for early human language-like capacities in non-human species.

Recently, studies showed that chimpanzees� manual laterality is influenced by functional, interactional and individual factors and their mutual intertwinement. However, what about manual laterality in species living in stable social groups? We tackled this question by studying three groups of captive gorillas (N = 35) and analysed their most frequent manual signals: three manipulators and 16 gesture types. Our multifactorial investigation showed that conspecific-directed gestures were overall more right-lateralized than conspecific-directed manipulators. Furthermore, it revealed a difference between conspecific- and human-directed gestural laterality for signallers living in one of the study groups. Our results support the hypothesis that gestural laterality is a relevant marker of language left-brain specialisation. We suggest that components of communication and of manipulation (not only of an object but also of a conspecific) do not share the same lateralised cerebral system in some primate species.

22445329;pi133;From imitation to meaning: Circuit plasticity and the acquisition of a conventionalized semantics;"García R R; Zamorano F; Aboitiz F";Journal Article;The capacity for language is arguably the most remarkable innovation of the human brain. A relatively recent interpretation prescribes that part of the language-related circuits were co-opted from circuitry involved in hand control�the mirror neuron system (MNS), involved both in the perception and in the execution of voluntary grasping actions. A less radical view is that in early humans, communication was opportunistic and multimodal, using signs, vocalizations or whatever means available to transmit social information. However, one point that is not yet clear under either perspective is how learned communication acquired a semantic property thereby allowing us to name objects and eventually describe our surrounding environment. Here we suggest a scenario involving both manual gestures and learned vocalizations that led to the development of a primitive form of conventionalized reference. This proposal is based on comparative evidence gathered from other species and on neurolinguistic evidence in humans, which points to a crucial role for vocal learning in the early development of language. Firstly, the capacity to direct the attention of others to a common object may have been crucial for developing a consensual referential system. Pointing, which is a ritualized grasping gesture, may have been crucial to this end. Vocalizations also served to generate joint attention among conversants, especially when combined with gaze direction. Another contributing element was the development of pantomimic actions resembling events or animals. In conjunction with this mimicry, the development of plastic neural circuits that support complex, learned vocalizations was probably a significant factor in the evolution of conventionalized semantics in our species. Thus, vocal imitations of sounds, as in onomatopoeias (words whose sound resembles their meaning), are possibly supported by mirror system circuits, and may have been relevant in the acquisition of early meanings.

22445283;pi134;Forelimb preferences in human beings and other species: Multiple models for testing hypotheses on lateralization;"Versace E; Vallortigara G";Journal Article;Functional preferences in the use of right/left forelimbs are not exclusively present in humans but have been widely documented in a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species. A matter of debate is whether non-human species exhibit a degree and consistency of functional forelimb asymmetries comparable to human handedness. The comparison is made difficult by the variability in hand use in humans and the few comparable studies conducted on other species. In spite of this, interesting continuities appear in functions such as feeding, object manipulation and communicative gestures. Studies on invertebrates show how widespread forelimb preferences are among animals, and the importance of experience for the development of forelimb asymmetries. Vertebrate species have been extensively investigated to clarify the origins of forelimb functional asymmetries: comparative evidence shows that selective pressures for different functions have likely driven the evolution of human handedness. Evidence of a complex genetic architecture of human handedness is in line with the idea of multiple evolutionary origins of this trait.

Important aspects of selfies especially in relation to gender include the tilt of the head, the side of the face exhibited, mood and head position, later related also to the context of the selfie picture.

In two experiments, infants reached for objects when another person was present and when no one else was present; the distance to the objects was varied. When alone, the infants reached for objects within their action boundaries and refrained from reaching for objects out of their action boundaries; thus, they knew about their individual action efficiency. However, when a parent (Experiment 1) or a less familiar person (Experiment 2) sat next to them, the infants selectively increased their reaching for out-of-reach objects. The findings reveal that before they communicate explicitly through pointing gestures, infants use instrumental actions with the apparent expectation that a partner will adopt and complete their goals.

22445323;pi137;Language, gesture, and handedness: Evidence for independent lateralized networks;"Haberling IS; Corballis PM; Corballis MC";Journal Article;Language, gesture, and handedness are in most people represented in the left cerebral hemisphere. To explore the relations among these attributes, we collected fMRI images in a large sample of left- and right-handers while they performed language tasks and watched action sequences. Regions of interest included the frontal and parietal areas previously identified as comprising an action�observation network, and the frontal and temporal areas comprising the primary areas for language production and comprehension. All of the language areas and most of the action�observation areas showed an overall left-hemispheric bias, despite the participation of equal numbers of left- and right-handers. A factor analysis of the laterality indices derived from the different areas during the tasks indicated three independent networks, one associated with language, one associated with handedness, and one representing action observation independent of handedness. Areas 44 and 45, which together make up Broca's area, were part of the language and action�observation networks, but were not included in the part of the action observation network that was related to handedness, which in turn was strongly linked to areas in the parietal lobe. These results suggest an evolutionary scenario in which the primate mirror neuron system (MNS) became increasingly lateralized, and later fissioned onto subsystems with one mediating language and the other mediating the execution and observation of manual actions. The second network is further subdivided into one dependent on hand preference and one that is not, providing new insight into the tripartite system of language, handedness, and praxis.

We compared the gestures and baby signs produced by twenty-three children with DS (Mage = 2;6) and twenty-three TD children (Mage = 1;6), in relation to their expressive spoken vocabulary size one year later. Children with DS showed significant deficits in gesture production, particularly for deictic gestures, but strengths in baby sign production, compared to their typically developing peers. More importantly, it was the baby signs produced by children with DS, but not deictic gestures, that predicted their spoken vocabulary size one year later. Our results further highlight the important role baby signs can play in language development in children with developmental disorders.

Studies on the development of systems for processing faces and language have yielded such similarities as perceptual narrowing across both domains. In this article, we review several functions of human communication, and then describe how the tools used to accomplish those functions are modified by perceptual narrowing. We conclude that narrowing is common to all forms of social communication. We argue that during evolution, social communication engaged different perceptual and cognitive systems�face, facial expression, gesture, vocalization, sound, and oral language�that emerged at different times. These systems are interactive and linked to some extent. In this framework, narrowing can be viewed as a way infants adapt to their native social group.

22445441;pi141;Concealing of facial expressions by a wild Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus);"Thunstrom M; Kuchenbuch P; Young C";Journal Article;Behavioural research on non-vocal communication among non-human primates and its possible links to the origin of human language is a long-standing research topic. Because human language is under voluntary control, it is of interest whether this is also true for any communicative signals of other species. It has been argued that the behaviour of hiding a facial expression with one�s hand supports the idea that gestures might be under more voluntary control than facial expressions among non-human primates, and it has also been interpreted as a sign of intentionality. So far, the behaviour has only been reported twice, for single gorilla and chimpanzee individuals, both in captivity. Here, we report the first observation of concealing of facial expressions by a monkey, a Barbary macaque (Macacasylvanus), living in the wild. On eight separate occasions between 2009 and 2011 an adult male was filmed concealing two different facial expressions associated with play and aggression ('play face' and 'scream face'), 22 times in total. The videos were analysed in detail, including gaze direction, hand usage, duration, and individuals present. This male was the only individual in his group to manifest this behaviour, which always occurred in the presence of a dominant male. Several possible interpretations of the function of the behaviour are discussed. The observations in this study indicate that the gestural communication and cognitive abilities of monkeys warrant more research attention.

22445585;pi142;Neural expectations: A possible evolutionary path from manual skills to language;"Arbib M A; Rizzolatti G";Journal Article;Discusses the idea of linking the evolution of language to manual gesture. The authors argue that there is a mechanism in the grasp system that is able to recognize actions. They assert the crucial role of an observation/execution matching system for grasping in monkeys which provides a representation of 'expectations' which can both guide the monkey's own actions and enable it to comprehend the actions of other monkeys. It is argued that it is the addition of such an observation system that provides the necessary bridge from 'doing' to 'communicating about doing.' This claim is bolstered by the finding that observation/execution system is located in monkey in an area which is considered the homolog of Broca's area in humans. A 'case grammar' for grasping that suggests the continuity between praxis and language is offered. However, the authors stress mechanisms that seem to distinguish language from other forms of praxis and analyze a number of human brain mechanisms, including those for consciousness, in that light.

22445701;pi143;Hadza handedness: Lateralized behaviors in a contemporary hunter�gatherer population;"Cavanagh T; Berbesque J C; Wood B; Marlowe F";Journal Article;Handedness has been studied extensively in Western populations and in non-human primates. Seldom, however, has this focus been extended to non-industrialized populations. This study examines handedness from an evolutionary perspective in an ecologically meaningful setting. The sampled population, the Hadza of Tanzania, are a contemporary hunter�gatherer people whose handedness behaviors represent an important, and yet neglected, avenue of investigation. Ethological sampling methods were utilized based on recorded video footage of an ethnographic nature. This footage was coded and analyzed to document dominant hand use in a range of evolutionarily relevant activities, such as hunting and foraging tasks. Strength of lateralization was compared across task categories. The results demonstrate that the Hadza are extremely lateralized in tool-use tasks, with 96% of all tool-use tasks being executed with the right hand. Importantly, strength of lateralization was not influenced by degree of tool complexity. They were less strongly lateralized for more commonplace, empty-handed tasks (such as eating or communicative gestures). They were the least lateralized in object manipulation tasks. These results support theoretical scenarios which place tool use at the centre in the evolution of human right-handedness.

These different phases did not replace each other, but became reorganized in the brain at different hierarchical levels. It is argued that (a) humans are an ultracooperative species and (b) high degrees of cooperation put strong selective pressures toward the development of sophisticated forms of intersubjective communication. These two developments had cascading effects on human evolution, creating both the conditions upon which humans were able to understand intentions, gestures, emotions, and, ultimately, the minds of others, and the emergence of language and symbolic forms of cultural evolution. Possible evolutionary steps that led to this ultracooperative survival strategy and some of their genetic mechanism, with special emphasis on a multilevel model of selection, are described, and the implications for psychotherapy and psychoanalysis are explored.

22445071;pi146;Die evolutionare Perspektive in der Verbindung von Korper, Geist und Ausdruck;Kriz J;Journal Article;In Gestalt psychology, the holistic organization of the phenomenal world (and its underlying, correlated neural dynamic) is crucial. Following Arnheim�s (1949) analysis, we have to say that expression could be defined as the psychological counterpart of the dynamic processes�led by the phenomenal world�which result in the organization of perceptual stimuli. Therefore, observing a 'graceful gesture' of a dancer is an integral part of the organized processes of perception in the observer. However, there is a lot of evidence that the phenomenal world of the dancer will direct the muscular forces which produce the 'graceful gesture' of his arm and hand. As a consequence, it is plausible that the phenomenal world which organizes the bodily behavior of the dancer is partly structurally similar to the phenomenal world of the person who perceives this gesture and, moreover, that there are corresponding mental states. These aspects are not surprising if one takes the evolution of mankind into account. All living beings have evolutionarily developed in adaption (and more or less co-adaption) to a so-called 'ecological niche'. This is, of course, also true for human beings. However: the 'ecological niche' of humans is not so governed by material and biological structures of the environment. But the 'ecological niche' for humans� evolutionary development is the social system constituted of a group or society of interacting, cooperating, and communicating humans. More specifically, humans� brains have developed so as to serve as a means of surviving in such a social system. This is the thesis of the prevailing discourse under the term 'social brain'. The present paper discusses some aspects of the interactions between body, mind and expression from the 'social brain' perspective. The importance of self-reflective processes in the phenomenal world as well as the ability to refer verbally to one�s own and another person�s state of mind ('mentalization') is stressed, and the developmental conditions necessary for a child to unfold these evolutionary and inborn potentials are examined.

22445204;pi148;Relation entre dyspraxie gestuelle et dyslexie chez des enfants avec troubles des apprentissages;"Dewaele J; Bartolo A; Macchi L; Cautillon M";Journal Article;"Gestures and language are thought as two cognitive functions that are closely linked. From an evolutionary point of view, recent theories suggest that language evolved from manual gestures, rather than from animal vocal call. Moreover, in developmental psychology, several studies have revealed the role of gestures in the development of language abilities. In neuropsychology, the recent cognitive models of praxis processing have been mapped onto the cognitive models of written language processing, further suggesting an analogy between the way gestures and higher language abilities are processed. If gestures have a role in language development, a deficit in processing gestures should affect reading abilities. We report the case of five children (three with visuo-constructive disorders, two with dyslexia and one with both visuo-constructive disorder and dyslexia) who were tested using a series of tasks targetting reading and praxis abilities. Tasks assessing recognition, comprehension and production of gestures and language were included to evaluate the integrity of the lexical routes. Tasks to evaluate imitation of meaningless gestures and the ability to read pseudo-words were also included to investigate the sub-lexical routes. Results showed that children having visuo-constructive disorders were also affected by limb dyspraxia and dyslexia and that the language and praxis profiles based on the cognitive models were similar. In particular, the two children with visuo-constructive disorders showed a deficit at the lexical and sub-lexical routes for both gestures and language; the child with both dyslexia and visuo-constructive disorders had difficulties in the production of meaningful gestures and in meaningless actions imitation, as well as in reading words and pseudo-words. This pattern of results was compatible with a deficit at the level of the buffers as proposed by the two cognitive models. The two dyslexic children did not show any sign of limb dyspraxia, and their dyslexia was mainly attributed to a deficit to the lexical and sub-lexical route in one case; and to the sub-lexical route in the other case. Overall, results showed that those children with deficits in gesture processing also had difficulties in reading, but that children presenting only dyslexia did not show any sign of praxis impairments. Taken together, these findings are in line with the idea that gesture might play a role in the development of language abilities.

22445308;pi150;Differences in the ability of apes and children to instruct others using gestures;"Grosse K; Call J; Carpenter M; Tomasello M";Journal Article;In all human cultures, people gesture iconically. However, the evolutionary basis of iconic gestures is unknown. In this study, chimpanzees and bonobos, and 2- and 3-year-old children, learned how to operate two apparatuses to get rewards. Then, at test, only a human adult had access to the apparatuses, and participants could instruct her about how to obtain the rewards. Children frequently produced appropriate iconic gestures, but with the exception of one human-raised chimpanzee, great apes did not gesture iconically. However, chimpanzees pointed to a reward outside the apparatus in another experimental condition, showing their motivation and ability to communicate with the human to request it. They also manipulated a duplicate apparatus in appropriate ways, though it was unclear if they did this to communicate with the human. Although great apes may have some of the prerequisite skills involved, iconic gestures come naturally to humans in a way that they do not for great apes.

The evolution in the computer hardware technology has boosted the development of real-time applications which are expected to respond within a strict time frame. One attractive sophisticated application, which requires real time response, is image capturing and recognition for effective human computer interaction. It is gaining popularity, especially after the development of hand held devices and touch screens. Real-time video processing response time is expressed by means of frame sequences; device dependent capability (20 frame/sec) designates real-time restrictions (a frame is needed to be processed within 50 ms). Video processing of virtual mouse operations requires real-time recognition, i.e., no delay in response can be tolerated. There are indeed several attempts to recognize hand gestures for different purposes. Sign language recognition stands out as the most popular one. However, virtual mouse operations may also be used in general by the majority of people in parallel for the proliferation of different applications on a variety of platforms such as tablet PCs, embedded devices, etc. One significant advantage of such systems fulfills the need for extra hardware system. To this end, we have developed a novel real-time virtual mouse application. Our system architecture recognizes defined postures and gestures. We have implemented, tested, and compared the performance of four methods, namely Chai (static), face (dynamic), regional (dynamic), and Duan. Further, various conditions, such as lighting, distinguishing skin color, and complex background have been considered and discussed.

22444864;pi152;Embodiment in simulation theory and cultural science, with remarks on the coding-problem of neuroscience;Weigel S;Book Chapter;The chapter discusses the role of cultural sciences (Kulturwissenschaften) in bridging the still existing gap between neuroscience and psychoanalysis against the background of the rising interest in mirror mechanisms, mimetic functions, imitation, simulation, embodiment, language and metaphors as well as their proximity to figures that have long belonged to the traditional subjects of the humanities. Knowledge on human expressions within a cultural-historical time-frame may be adduced to bridge the gap between data from empirical research and the evolution of the brain based on speculative knowledge. Weigel concentrates on certain unsolved epistemological problems to be reconsidered in light of knowledge from cultural science. Drawing on Freud and Walter Benjamin, she examines the quantity-quality-problem and the coding problem in simulation theory with reference to theories of language, gesture and image in the humanities. An example completes the chapter's presentation of the cultural production of 'compassion' in medieval times in relation to the concept of empathy in recent neuroscience.

A starting point for demonstrating the existence of culture that has been used for many species including chimpanzees and orangutans is to show that there is geographic variation in the occurrence of particular behavioral traits inferred to be a result of social learning and not ecological or genetic influences. Gorillas live in a wide variety of habitats across Africa and they exhibit flexibility in diet, behavior, and social structure. Here we apply the �method of exclusion� to look for the presence/absence of behaviors that could be considered potential cultural traits in well-habituated groups from five study sites of the two species of gorillas. Of the 41 behaviors considered, 23 met the criteria of potential cultural traits, of which one was foraging related, nine were environment related, seven involved social interactions, five were gestures, and one was communication related. There was a strong positive correlation between behavioral dissimilarity and geographic distance among gorilla study sites. Roughly half of all variation in potential cultural traits was intraspecific differences (i.e. variability among sites within a species) and the other 50% of potential cultural traits were differences between western and eastern gorillas. Further research is needed to investigate if the occurrence of these traits is influenced by social learning. These findings emphasize the importance of investigating cultural traits in African apes and other species to shed light on the origin of human culture.

The authors view these as communicative behaviors that set humans apart from other species, and that bind people together in communities and other social groups. More specifically, they focus on the developmental use of external symbols to communicate with others. The chapter begins by considering the varieties of definitions, theoretical approaches, and recurring themes that have emerged from classic and contemporary work. The authors then use dominant themes from contemporary work to guide their review of the empirical findings from studies of language (including gesture), pretense, and material artifacts (including scale models, pictures, video, and maps). They argue that comparative research and cultural developmental studies provide important ways to deepen understanding of the origin of human symbolic representation, and thus they review such studies in their chapter. The chapter ends with a discussion of challenges faced by researchers who would like to move beyond offering insightful descriptions of symbolic development to providing process accounts of symbolic development.

22444970;pi155;Evidence for the universality of facial expressions of emotion;"Hwang H; Matsumoto D";Book Chapter;Nonverbal communication is often considered merely body language, but researchers have defined nonverbal communication as almost all of human communication except the spoken or written word. We broadly define nonverbal communication as the transfer and exchange of messages in any and all modalities that do not involve words. One of the major ways by which nonverbal communication occurs is through nonverbal behaviors, the dynamic behaviors that occur during communication that include facial expressions, gestures, tone of voice, and body postures. Of the various nonverbal behaviors, facial expressions are one of the most complex signal systems in the body. This chapter explores the scientific evidence for the universal expression and recognition of facial expressions of emotions. We first discuss the history of research on facial expressions of emotion, including early debates and positions, and review the ample scientific evidence for the universal expression and recognition of facial expressions of emotions. We then discuss how the universality of facial expressions of emotion informed our understanding of emotions, and in particular, a category of emotions known as basic emotions. We also discuss how facial signals of emotions interact with culture to demonstrate how biologically innate expressions can be modified by cultural learning. As a first step of understanding this area, we begin by describing the original debate about the universality of facial expressions of emotion.

22445493;pi156;Spatial generalization of imitation in dogs (Canis familiaris);"Fugazza C; Pogany A; Miklosi A";Journal Article;Dogs, like human infants, are able to imitate human actions after a delay (deferred imitation). This study demonstrates that in deferred imitation tasks, dogs can generalize imitation across context modification to a certain extent. Specifically, they can imitate an object-related action if the object used by the demonstrator is displaced to a different location. However, if the object is interchanged with a different one, their imitative performance drops while they show a spatial bias toward the location of demonstration. We used a combination of the 2-action procedure and the 'Do as I do' paradigm and displaced the target objects manipulated by the demonstrator, so that, at the time of recall, dogs could only match either the original location of demonstration or the displaced object, but not both. In conditions with a single object present and displaced after the demonstration, dogs matched the action and the object on which it was shown. In conditions with the location of 2 objects interchanged, dogs more likely matched the location. However, when humans provided ostensive cues and pointing gestures to draw the subjects� attention toward the displaced target object, dogs� predisposition to follow human communication outweighed their spatial bias and, as a consequence, their object matching and imitative performance increased. We conclude that object�s physical features function as retrieval cues that facilitate recalling the action. In addition to figurative information, dogs rely strongly on spatial information in Do as I do tasks. The results are discussed concerning dogs� representational system of imitative actions.

22445240;pi157;The repertoire and intentionality of gestural communication in wild chimpanzees;"Roberts A I; Roberts S G B; Vick S J";Journal Article;A growing body of evidence suggests that human language may have emerged primarily in the gestural rather than vocal domain, and that studying gestural communication in great apes is crucial to understanding language evolution. Although manual and bodily gestures are considered distinct at a neural level, there has been very limited consideration of potential differences at a behavioural level. In this study, we conducted naturalistic observations of adult wild East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytesschweinfurthii) in order to establish a repertoire of gestures, and examine intentionality of gesture production, use and comprehension, comparing across manual and bodily gestures. At the population level, 120 distinct gesture types were identified, consisting of 65 manual gestures and 55 bodily gestures. Both bodily and manual gestures were used intentionally and effectively to attain specific goals, by signallers who were sensitive to recipient attention. However, manual gestures differed from bodily gestures in terms of communicative persistence, indicating a qualitatively different form of behavioural flexibility in achieving goals. Both repertoire size and frequency of manual gesturing were more affiliative than bodily gestures, while bodily gestures were more antagonistic. These results indicate that manual gestures may have played a significant role in the emergence of increased flexibility in great ape communication and social bonding.

22445122;pi158;The emergence of modern communication in primates: A computational approach;"Benitez-Burraco A; Mineiro A; Castro-Caldas A";Book Chapter;It is biological structures (and their activities), and not the diverse functions they contribute to (i.e., forms of behavior), that evolve. We believe that the long-lasting controversy around when modern language appeared would benefit from a shift of focus, from 'communication' to 'computation.' Computation is the activity performed by specific neural devices. Computational devices (and their neurobiological correlates), but not communication devices, have a common evolutionary history. We further expect that computational devices are functionally coupled to different interface systems, thus rendering diverse kinds of outputs and eventually contributing to different functions (forms of behaviors). Multiple evidence (genetic, neurobiological, clinical, archeological, fossil, and ethological) suggest that the computational device of human language (the faculty of language in the narrow sense, after Chomsky) is an evolutionary novelty that appeared along with anatomically modern humans. Importantly, this does not preclude that other extinct hominins had 'language.' It is just that the strings of symbols they were plausibly able to produce lacked certain structural properties that we can only find in extant oral or sign languages. Hominin oral 'languages' (or better perhaps, 'protolanguages') could have replaced signed 'languages' at some early period during hominin evolution. Nonetheless, the gestural 'languages' (or better, 'protolanguages') hypothetically employed by other extinct hominids would have been less structurally complex than extant human languages are.

23080869;pi159;Reconsidering the scribbling stage of drawing: A new perspective on toddlers' representational processes;"Longobardi C; Quaglia R; Iotti N";Journal Article;Although the scribbling stage of drawing has been historically regarded as meaningless and transitional, a sort of prelude to the 'actual' drawing phase of childhood, recent studies have begun to re-evaluate this important moment of a child�s development and find meaning in what was once considered mere motor activity and nothing more. The present study analyzes scribbling in all its subphases and discovers a clear intention behind young children�s gestures. From expressing the dynamic qualities of an object and the child�s relationship with it, to gradually reducing itself to a simple contour of a content no more 'alive' on the paper, but only in the child�s own imagination, we trace the evolution of the line as a tool that toddlers use to communicate feelings and intentions to the world that surrounds them. We will provide a selected number of graphical examples that are representative of our theory. These drawings (13 in total) were extracted from a much wider sample derived from our studies on children�s graphical-pictorial abilities, conducted on children aged 0�3 years in various Italian nurseries. Our results appear to indicate that scribbling evolves through a series of stages, and that early graphical activity in children is sparked and maintained by their relationship with their caregivers and the desire to communicate with them.

22445772;pi160;The language void: The need for multimodality in primate communication research;"Slocombe K E; Waller  B M; Liebal K";Journal Article;Theories of language evolution often draw heavily on comparative evidence of the communicative abilities of extant nonhuman primates (primates). Many theories have argued exclusively for a unimodal origin of language, usually gestural or vocal. Theories are often strengthened by research on primates that indicates the absence of certain linguistic precursors in the opposing communicative modality. However, a systematic review of the primate communication literature reveals that vocal, gestural and facial signals have attracted differing theoretical and methodological approaches, rendering cross-modal comparisons problematic. The validity of the theories based on such comparisons can therefore be questioned. We propose that these a priori biases, inherent in unimodal research, highlight the need for integrated multimodal research. By examining communicative signals in concert we can both avoid methodological discontinuities as well as better understand the phylogenetic precursors to human language as part of a multimodal system.

22444963;pi161;Gestures and social_emotional communicative development in chimpanzee infants;"Bard K A; Dunbar S; Maguire-Herring V; Veira Y; Hayes K G; McDonald K";Journal Article;Communicative skills of chimpanzees are of significant interest across many domains, such as developmental psychology (how does communication emerge in prelinguistic beings?), evolution (e.g., did human language evolve from primate gestures?), and in comparative psychology (how does the nonverbal communication of chimpanzees and humans compare?). Here we ask about how gestures develop in chimpanzee infants (n = 16) that were raised in an interactive program designed to study skill development. Data on socio_communicative development were collected following 4 hr of daily interaction with each infant, longitudinally from birth through the first year of life. A consistent and significant developmental pattern was found across the contexts of tickle play, grooming, and chase play: Infant chimpanzees first engaged in interactions initiated by others, then they initiated interactions, and finally, they requested others to join them in the interaction. Gestures were documented for initiating and requesting tickle play, for initiating and requesting grooming, and for initiating and requesting chase play. Gestural requests emerged significantly later than gestural initiations, but the age at which gestures emerged was significantly different across contexts. Those gestures related to hierarchical rank relations, that is, gestures used by subordinates in interaction with more dominant individuals, such as wrist presenting and rump presenting, did not emerge in the same manner as the other gestures. This study offers a new view on the development of gestures, specifically that many develop through interaction and communicate socio_emotional desires, but that not all gestures emerge in the same manner.

In the original article, there were some mistakes in the 'Methods/Participants' section on page 224.

Parents translate these gestures into words, facilitating children�s acquisition of these words (Goldin-Meadow et al. in Dev Sci 10(6):778�785, 2007). We ask whether this pattern holds for children with autism (AU) and with Down syndrome (DS) who show delayed vocabulary development. We observed 23 children with AU, 23 with DS, and 23 TD children with their parents over a year. Children used gestures to indicate objects before labeling them and parents translated their gestures into words. Importantly, children benefited from this input, acquiring more words for the translated gestures than the not translated ones. Results highlight the role contingent parental input to child gesture plays in language development of children with developmental disorders.

23080892;pi163;Learned vocal and breathing behavior in an enculturated gorilla;"Perlman M; Clark N";Journal Article;We describe the repertoire of learned vocal and breathing-related behaviors (VBBs) performed by the enculturated gorilla Koko. We examined a large video corpus of Koko and observed 439 VBBs spread across 161 bouts. Our analysis shows that Koko exercises voluntary control over the performance of nine distinctive VBBs, which involve variable coordination of her breathing, larynx, and supralaryngeal articulators like the tongue and lips. Each of these behaviors is performed in the context of particular manual action routines and gestures. Based on these and other findings, we suggest that vocal learning and the ability to exercise volitional control over vocalization, particularly in a multimodal context, might have figured relatively early into the evolution of language, with some rudimentary capacity in place at the time of our last common ancestor with great apes.

In the original article, there were some errors in the Acknowledgments. The corrected Acknowledgments statement is present in the erratum.] According to a theoretical tradition dating back to Aristotle, verbs can be classified into two broad categories. Telic verbs (e.g., 'decide,' 'sell,' 'die') encode a logical endpoint, whereas atelic verbs (e.g., 'think,' 'negotiate,' 'run') do not, and the denoted event could therefore logically continue indefinitely. Here we show that sign languages encode telicity in a seemingly universalway andmoreover that even nonsigners lacking any prior experiencewith sign language understand these encodings. In experiments 1�5, nonsigning English speakers accurately distinguished between telic (e.g., 'decide') and atelic (e.g., 'think') signs from (the historically unrelated) Italian Sign Language, Sign Language of the Netherlands, and Turkish Sign Language. These results were not due to participants� inferring that the sign merely imitated the action in question. In experiment 6, we used pseudosigns to show that the presence of a salient visual boundary at the end of a gesture was sufficient to elicit telic interpretations, whereas repeated movement without salient boundaries elicited atelic interpretations. Experiments 7�10 confirmed that these visual cues were used by all of the sign languages studied here. Together, these results suggest that signers and nonsigners share universally accessible notions of telicity as well as universally accessible 'mapping biases' between telicity and visual form.

These different phases did not replace each other, but became re-organized in the brain at different hierarchical levels. It is argued that (1) humans are an ultra-cooperative species, and (2) high degrees of cooperation put strong selective pressures toward the development of sophisticated forms of intersubjective communication. These two developments had cascading effects on human evolution, creating both the conditions upon which humans were able to understand intentions, gestures, emotions and ultimately the minds of others, and the emergence of language and symbolic forms of cultural evolution. Possible evolutionary steps that led to this ultra-cooperative survival strategy and some of their genetic mechanism, with special emphasis on a multilevel model of selection, are described, and the implications for psychotherapy and psychoanalysis are explored.

22445301;pi169;What is the nature of the gestural communication of great apes?;Pika S;Book Chapter;Human speech is frequently accompanied by movements of the arms and hands termed gestures. The majority of these gestures is invented spontaneously and is highly iconic but some gestures are used functionally in ways very similar to speech that is symbolically, referentially, based on intersubjectively learned and shared social conventions. Our closest living relatives, the great apes also use gestures in their natural communication in a variety of contexts such as play, grooming, sex and agonistic encounters. A deep understanding of apes' gestural signalling might therefore be helpful to get insight into the evolutionary scenario of human communication and cognition. The present chapter investigates the nature of the gestural signalling of the four great apes, bonobos (Pan paniscus), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and orangutans (Pongo pygmoeus), with a special focus on the following three aspects: (1) the intentionality of gestures, (2) their referential use, and (3) similarities and differences to gestures in prelinguistic or just-linguistic human infants.

LekBot was developed to facilitate independent and enjoyable play on equal terms for children with significant communication disabilities and their peers. Using Conversation Analysis, participatory symmetry and enjoyment were investigated in relation to spoken and gestural communication, embodied stance, gaze, and affective display. Data originated from three video-recorded sessions that were approximately 2 hours long. Four different interaction situations were identified and explored: Participatory Asymmetry, Adult Facilitation, Greater Participatory Symmetry and Creativity, and Turn-taking and Enjoyable Play with LekBot. Neither participatory symmetry nor enjoyment were easily achieved in the play sessions and may require considerable effort, including adult involvement, but creative, spontaneous and highly enjoyable play, correlating with participatory symmetry to various degrees, was observed in a few instances. The findings are discussed with regard to play, AAC and the future development of robots to facilitate play.

22445462;pi174;Introduction: Where does 'Where do nouns come from?' come from?;Haviland J B ;Journal Article;This article discusses the papers presented in the issue Gesture. The collection of four papers in this special issue of Gesture began life as an organized panel, called 'How to invent nouns', at the meetings of the International Society for Gesture Studies held in Lund in July 2012. The papers in the original panel in turn had an intertwined history. The assumption shared by most linguists and by the authors represented in this collection that languages seem to need a formal distinction between nouns and verbs here provides a compelling motivation for detailed formal studies of practices of visible communication, as a necessary part of understanding human language.

22445594;pi175;Language;Corballis M C ;Book Chapter;In this chapter, I suggest how language might have evolved, beginning with the Chomskyan notion that true language is uniquely human, and dependent on rules rather than on associative learning. Those rules are embodied in grammar. Although the ability to use symbols to refer to real-world objects and actions may be present in many other species, true language involves grammar--the ability to combine symbols according to rules to create an infinity of possible meanings. I have argued that this ability emerged relatively late in hominid evolution, and probably began with the genus Homo within the past 2 million years. One of the critical questions is whether it emerged suddenly, as a 'big bang', or whether it unfolded in several steps. Another critical question is whether the recursive nature of grammar was specific to language, or whether it represented some more general recursive ability that also underlies such human activities as manufacture, theory of mind, mental time travel, and perhaps music. Language should not be equated with speech. I have taken the provocative step of arguing that language actually evolved from manual gestures rather than from vocal calls. The evidence suggests that the neural and anatomical changes necessary for the production of speech were completed very late in hominid evolution, even later than the emergence of recursive grammar. It may have emerged with, and indeed defined, our own species, Homo sapiens, a mere 170,000 or so years ago. I have also provocatively adopted the view that speech itself is fundamentally gestural rather than acoustic, so that the transition from manual to vocal gestures was effectively a continuous process--even today, people ubiquitously gesture with their hands while they speak. Recent work on the mirror system suggests that the perception of gestures, whether manual or articulatory, depends on a direct mapping from perception to production, as long anticipated by the motor theory of speech perception. Work on the FOXP2 gene suggests that the final step in the evolution of autonomous speech may have occurred even more recently than the appearance of Homo sapiens, perhaps within the past 100,000 years, in Africa.

Although gestural repertoires have been compiled for captive and wild primates, reports are largely qualitative. We quantify the morphological structure and variation of gestural signals identified in the repertoire of a community of wild chimpanzees. Gestures were classified on the basis of 29 morphological features, such as trajectory and orientation during the preparatory and stroke phases of a gesture. Hierarchical cluster and discriminant function analyses identified 30 morphologically distinct manual gesture types; the majority was subsequently correctly classified using a cross-validation technique, with incorrect classifications for rare gesture types only. Comparisons of this statistically determined repertoire with previous repertoires did not identify systematic variation between captive and wild chimpanzees. Moreover, consensus was not greater within studies of the same populations, highlighting the importance of systematic and well-documented inventories. Our morphologically based analyses indicate that manual gestures are best considered as graded rather than discrete communication signals, similar to some vocalisation systems. We discuss these findings in light of current theories of human language evolution.

In the original article, there were some errors in Appendix A. The corrected Appendix A is present in the erratum.] Background: Gesture frequently accompanies speech in healthy speakers. For many individuals with aphasia, gestures are a target of speech-language pathology intervention, either as an alternative form of communication or as a facilitative device for language restoration. The patterns of gesture production for people with aphasia and the participant variables that predict these patterns remain unclear. Aims:We aimed to examine gesture production during conversational discourse in a large sample of individuals with aphasia. We used a detailed gesture coding system to determine patterns of gesture production associated with specific aphasia types and severities. Methods & Procedures: We analysed conversation samples from Aphasia Bank, gathered from 46 people with post-stroke aphasia and 10 healthy matched controls all of whom had gestured at least once during a story re-tell task. Twelve gesture types were coded. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the patterns of gesture production. Possible significant differences in production patterns according to aphasia type and severity were examined with a series of analyses of variance (ANOVA) statistics, and multiple regression analysis was used to examine these potential predictors of gesture production patterns. Outcomes & Results: Individuals with aphasia gestured significantly more frequently than healthy controls. Aphasia type and severity impacted significantly on gesture type in specific identified patterns detailed here, especially on the production of meaning-laden gestures. Conclusions: These patterns suggest the opportunity for gestures as targets of aphasia therapy. Aphasia fluency accounted for a greater degree of data variability than aphasia severity or naming skills. More work is required to delineate predictive factors.

23080860;pi179;Redefining the role of Broca�s area in speech;"Flinker A; Korzeniewska A; Shestyuk A; Franaszczuk P; Dronkers N; Knight R; Crone N";Journal Article;For over a century neuroscientists have debated the dynamics by which human cortical language networks allow words to be spoken. Although it is widely accepted that Broca�s area in the left inferior frontal gyrus plays an important role in this process, it was not possible, until recently, to detail the timing of its recruitment relative to other language areas, nor how it interacts with these areas during word production. Using direct cortical surface recordings in neurosurgical patients, we studied the evolution of activity in cortical neuronal populations, as well as the Granger causal interactions between them. We found that, during the cued production of words, a temporal cascade of neural activity proceeds from sensory representations of words in temporal cortex to their corresponding articulatory gestures in motor cortex. Broca�s area mediates this cascade through reciprocal interactions with temporal and frontal motor regions. Contrary to classic notions of the role of Broca�s area in speech, while motor cortex is activated during spoken responses, Broca�s area is surprisingly silent. Moreover, when novel strings of articulatory gestures must be produced in response to non-word stimuli, neural activity is enhanced in Broca�s area, but not in motor cortex. These unique data provide evidence that Broca�s area coordinates the transformation of information across large-scale cortical networks involved in spoken word production. In this role, Broca�s area formulates an appropriate articulatory code to be implemented by motor cortex.

22445184;pi180;A systematic review of gesture treatments for post-stroke aphasia;"Rose M; Raymer A; Lanyon L; Attard M ";Journal Article;Background: Gesture is often used as a modality to promote recovery of communication in aphasia, both as a compensation device and as a facilitator of language recovery. To date, there has been no systematic analysis of the quantitative effects of gesture training for aphasia in light of the quality of the research methods undertaken. Aims: The aim of the current project was to systematically evaluate the scientific evidence for the effects of symbolic and nonsymbolic gestural training in post-stroke aphasia. Specifically, we aimed to evaluate the effects of gesture treatment for measures of verbal and nonverbal communication. Methods & Procedures: A systematic search of the literature was conducted between August and September 2012, on relevant electronic databases utilising 16 search terms. Study characteristics were summarised. The methodological quality of the studies was independently rated by the first two authors, using the PEDro and SCED scales for group and single-case experimental designs (SCEDs), respectively. Effect sizes were calculated where none was provided by the original manuscript. Results: This initial search yielded 177 citations, of which 23 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria: 4 group designs and 19 SCEDs. Of the 134 individuals who participated in these studies, the majority had nonfluent moderate�severe chronic aphasia. Methodological rigour was weak in the group studies, but 11 of the 19 SCEDs achieved high-quality scores of 8 or higher out of 10. Gesture training alone had nonsignificant effects on verbal production. Combined gesture + verbal training showed positive effects for verbal production of nouns and verbs for over 50% of participants, with a mixed pattern of generalisation to untrained words and contexts. Gesture + verbal training paradigms had limited advantage over those with verbal training alone. Significant gains in gesture production were reported for trained gestures only following gesture training protocols. Few studies have examined generalisation to discourse. The effects of training with nonsymbolic gestures were less conclusive. Conclusions: Comparative effect sizes support a benefit of combined gesture + verbal treatment for noun and verb production for some individuals with aphasia. Whether that benefit surpasses the results of verbal treatment alone is not well established. Symbolic gestures can be acquired by individuals with aphasia, although their communicative effectiveness requires further study. Overall, gestural training in aphasia, while generating some positive outcomes, is relatively understudied. There is a need for large-scale investigation taking into account the considerable participant variability.

22445495;pi181;The development of speech acts;Cameron-Faulkner T ;Book Chapter;Children, like adults, use language to get things done. However, gaining an accurate picture of children's development of communicative intent is challenging. While the behaviours used by children to express intent are external and thus to some degree measurable, the underlying psychological characterisation of intent is much more elusive. Speech act analysis involves identifying the goal behind a speaker's utterance, gesture or sign, and provides a useful starting point for the analysis of communicative intent during both the pre-linguistic and linguistic stage. In the current chapter we begin by discussing the origins of Speech Act Theory and its relevance to child language development. We then discuss the emergence of speech acts in the language of young children, and also the relationship between form and function from a Speech Act perspective.

22445526;pi183;Shared developmental and evolutionary origins for neural basis of vocal�acoustic and pectoral�gestural signaling;"Bass A; Chagnaud B";Journal Article;Acoustic signaling behaviors are widespread among bony vertebrates, which include the majority of living fishes and tetrapods. Developmental studies in sound-producing fishes and tetrapods indicate that central pattern generating networks dedicated to vocalization originate from the same caudal hindbrain rhombomere (rh) 8-spinal compartment. Together, the evidence suggests that vocalization and its morphophysiological basis, including mechanisms of vocal�respiratory coupling that are widespread among tetrapods, are ancestral characters for bony vertebrates. Premotor-motor circuitry for pectoral appendages that function in locomotion and acoustic signaling develops in the same rh8-spinal compartment. Hence, vocal and pectoral phenotypes in fishes share both developmental origins and roles in acoustic communication. These findings lead to the proposal that the coupling of more highly derived vocal and pectoral mechanisms among tetrapods, including those adapted for nonvocal acoustic and gestural signaling, originated in fishes. Comparative studies further show that rh8 premotor populations have distinct neurophysiological properties coding for equally distinct behavioral attributes such as call duration. We conclude that neural network innovations in the spatiotemporal patterning of vocal and pectoral mechanisms of social communication, including forelimb gestural signaling, have their evolutionary origins in the caudal hindbrain of fishes.

22445249;pi184;The semantic origins of word order;"Schouwstra M; de Swart H";Journal Article;Where do the different sentence orders in the languages of the world come from? Recently, it has been suggested that there is a basic sentence order, SOV (Subject�Object�Verb), which was the starting point for other sentence orders. Backup for this claim was found in newly emerging languages, as well as in experiments where people are asked to convey simple meanings in improvised gesture production. In both cases, researchers found that the predominant word order is SOV. Recent literature has shown that the pragmatic rule �Agent first� drives the preference for S initial word order, but this rule does not decide between SOV and SVO. This paper presents experimental evidence for grounding the word order that emerges in gesture production in semantic properties of the message to be conveyed. We focus on the role of the verb, and argue that the preference for SOV word order reported in earlier experiments is due to the use of extensional verbs (e.g. throw). With intensional verbs like think, the object is dependent on the agent�s thought, and our experiment confirms that such verbs lead to a preference for SVO instead. We conclude that the meaning of the verb plays a crucial role in the sequencing of utterances in emerging language systems. This finding is relevant for the debate on language evolution, because it suggests that semantics underlies the early formation of syntactic rules.

22445387;pi186;The 'poly-modalic' nature of utterances and its relevance for inquiring in to language origins;Kendon A ;Book Chapter;In Chapter 6, Adam Kendon stresses that spoken language is not just vocal but poly-modal. When interacting face-to-face, speakers gesture with their hands, faces, and bodies. These gestural signals are 'neither supplements nor add-ons' but an integral part of each communicative act. To ask how language evolved, then, is to ask how humans evolved their unique capacity for poly-modalic communication. Speech and gesture, according to Kendon, must have evolved as modified versions of practical actions for mothering, grooming, mating, fighting, and/or obtaining food. One conclusion is that 'language', as the isolated component that is spoken, must have gradually developed through a process of specialization and differentiation.

22445580;pi187;What sign language creation teaches us about language;"Brentari D; Coppola M";Journal Article;How do languages emerge? What are the necessary ingredients and circumstances that permit new languages to form? Various researchers within the disciplines of primatology, anthropology, psychology, and linguistics have offered different answers to this question depending on their perspective. Language acquisition, language evolution, primate communication, and the study of spoken varieties of pidgin and creoles address these issues, but in this article we describe a relatively new and important area that contributes to our understanding of language creation and emergence. Three types of communication systems that use the hands and body to communicate will be the focus of this article: gesture, homesign systems, and sign languages. The focus of this article is to explain why mapping the path from gesture to homesign to sign language has become an important research topic for understanding language emergence, not only for the field of sign languages, but also for language in general.

This study sought to evaluate the feasibility for future trials of an expanded and restructured protocol designed to increase the efficacy of CIAT I. Method: The subjects were 4 native English speakers with chronic stroke who exhibited characteristics of moderate Broca�s aphasia. Treatment was carried out for 3.5 hr/day for 15 consecutive weekdays. It consisted of 3 components: (a) intensive training by a behavioral method termed shaping using a number of expressive language exercises in addition to the single original language card game, (b) strong discouragement of attempts to use gesture or other nonverbal means of communication, and (c) a transfer package of behavioral techniques to promote transfer of treatment gains from the laboratory to real-life situations. Results: Participation in speech in the life situation improved significantly after treatment. The effect sizes (i.e., d') in this domain were � 2.2; d' values � 0.8 are considered large. Improvement in language ability on a laboratory test, the Western Aphasia Battery�Revised (Kertesz, 2006), did not achieve statistical significance, although the effect size was large�that is, 1.3 (13.1 points).

22445556;pi189;The neural correlates of affect reading: An fMRI study on faces and gestures;"Prochnow D; Hoing B; Kleiser R; Lindenberg R; Wittsack H-J; Schafer R; Franz M; Seitz R J ";Journal Article;As complex social beings, people communicate, in addition to spoken language, also via nonverbal behavior. In social face-to-face situations, people readily read the affect and intentions of others in their face expressions and gestures recognizing their meaning. Importantly, the addressee further has to discriminate the meanings of the seen communicative motor acts in order to be able to react upon them appropriately. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study 15 healthy non-alexithymic right-handers observed video-clips that showed the dynamic evolution of emotional face expressions and gestures evolving from a neutral to a fully developed expression. We aimed at disentangling the cerebral circuits related to the observation of the incomplete and the subsequent discrimination of the evolved bodily expressions of emotion which are typical for everyday social situations. We show that the inferior temporal gyrus and the inferior and dorsal medial frontal cortex in both cerebral hemispheres were activated early in recognizing faces and gestures, while their subsequent discrimination involved the right dorsolateral frontal cortex. Interregional correlations showed that the involved regions constituted a widespread circuit allowing for a formal analysis of the seen expressions, their empathic processing and the subjective interpretation of their contextual meanings. Right�left comparisons revealed a greater activation of the right dorsal medial frontal cortex and the inferior temporal gyrus which supports the notion of a right hemispheric dominance for processing affective body expressions. These novel data provide a neurobiological basis for the intuitive understanding of other people which is relevant for socially appropriate decisions and intact social functioning.

In the original article, there was a mistake in the affiliation section. The corrected full affiliation for Josep Quer is present in the erratum.] Natural languages come in two different modalities�the aural-auditory modality of spoken languages and the visual-gestural modality of sign languages. The impact of modality on the grammatical system has been discussed at great length in the last 20 years. By contrast, the impact of modality on semantics in general and on ambiguities in particular has not yet been addressed in detail. In this paper, we deal with different types of ambiguities in sign languages. We discuss typical lexical and structural ambiguities as well as modality-specific aspects such as ambiguities in the use of the signing space and non-manual markers. In addition, we address the questions how sign languages avoid ambiguities and to what extent certain kinds of ambiguities and non-ambiguities depend on the visual-manual modality of sign languages. Since gestures use the same articulatory channel that is also active in the production of signs, we also discuss ambiguities between gestures on the one hand and grammaticalized gestures and signs on the other.

In this report we provide compelling evidence for the relationship between right hand grasp-to-mouth (i.e., feeding) movements and language development. Specifically, we show that children (4-5 years old) who are more right-hand lateralized in picking up small food items for consumption show enhanced differentiation of the 's' and 'sh' sounds. This result suggests that left hemisphere control of hand-to-mouth gestures may have provided an evolutionary platform for the development of language. The current investigation presents the exciting possibility that early right hand-to-mouth training could accelerate the development of articulation skills.

23080807;pi193;The role of human parietal area 7A as a link between sequencing in hand actions and in overt speech production;"Heim S; Amunts K; Hensel T; Grande M; Huber W; Binkofski F; Eickhoff S";Journal Article;"Research on the evolutionary basis of the human language faculty has proposed the mirror neuron system as a link between motor processing and speech development. Consequently, most work has focused on the left inferior frontal cortex, in particular Broca�s region, and the left inferior parietal cortex. However, the direct link between planning of hand motor and speech actions has yet to be elucidated. Thus, the present study investigated whether motor sequencing of hand vs. speech actions has a common neural denominator. For the hand motor task, 25 subjects performed single, repeated, or sequenced button presses with either the left or right hand. The speech task was in analogy; the same subjects produced the syllable 'po' once or repeatedly, or a sequence of different syllables ('po-pi-po'). Speech motor vs. hand motor effectors resulted in increased perisylvian activation including Broca�s region (left area 44 and areas medially adjacent to left area 45). In contrast, common activation for sequenced vs. repeated production of button presses and syllables revealed the effector-independent involvement of left area 7A in the superior parietal lobule (SPL) in sequencing. These data demonstrate that sequencing of vocal gestures, an important precondition for ordered utterances and ultimately human speech, shares area 7A, rather than inferior parietal regions, as a common cortical module with hand motor sequencing. Interestingly, area 7A has previously also been shown to be involved in the observation of hand and non-hand actions. In combination with the literature, the present data thus suggest a distinction between area 44, which is specifically recruited for (cognitive aspects of) speech, and SPL area 7A for general aspects of motor sequencing. In sum, the study demonstrates a previously underspecified role of the SPL in the origins of speech, and may be discussed in the light of embodiment of speech and language in the motor system.

Entrainment is asymmetric in so far as there is an ensemble leader who improvises and expands the structure of a last chorus of a piece of music beyond the limits tacitly negotiated during prior rehearsals and performances. Despite the risk of entrainment being disturbed and performance interrupted, the other three musicians in the quartet follow the leading performer and smoothly transition into unprecedented performance territory. We use this moment of live performance to work back through the fieldwork data, building a diachronic study of the development and bases of entrainment in live music performance.We introduce the concept of entrainment and profile previous theory and research relevant to entrainment in music performance. After outlining our methodology, we trace the evolution of the structure of the piece of music from first rehearsal to final performance. Using video clip analysis, interviews and field notes we consider how entrainment shaped and was shaped by the moment of performance in focus. The sense of trust between quartet musicians is established through entrainment processes, is consolidated via smooth adaptation to the threats of disruption. Non-verbal communicative exchanges, via eye contact, gesture, and spatial proximity, sustain entrainment through phase shifts occurring swiftly and on the fly in performance contexts. These exchanges permit smooth adaptation promoting trust. This frees the quartet members to play with the potential disturbance of equilibrium inherent in entrained relationships and to play with this tension in an improvisatory way that enhances audience engagement and the live quality of performance.

23080847;pi198;Imitation in neonatal chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes);"Myowa-Yamakoshi M; Tomonaga M; Tanaka M; Matsuzawa T";Journal Article;This paper provides evidence for imitative abilities in neonatal chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), our closest relatives. Two chimpanzees were reared from birth by their biological mothers. At less than 7 days of age the chimpanzees could discriminate between, and imitate, human facial gestures (tongue protrusion and mouth opening}. By the time they were 2 months old, however, the chimpanzees no longer imitated the gestures. They began to perform mouth opening frequently in response to any of the three facial gestures presented to them. These findings suggest that neonatal facial imitation is most likely an innate ability, developed through natural selection in humans and in chimpanzees. The relationship between the disappearance of neonatal imitation and the development of social communicative behavior is discussed from an evolutionary perspective.

22445097;pi199;Reevaluating chimpanzee vocal signals: Toward a multimodal account of the origins of human communication;See A;Book Chapter;The vocalizations of chimpanzees have long been thought to be largely genetically predetermined and therefore unlearnable, involuntarily produced, and broadcast indiscriminately. Tomasello (2008) has recently written that, while chimpanzee vocalizations share these constraints and limitations with the vocal displays of all other non-human animals, the attention-getting gestures of chimpanzees are an 'evolutionary novelty' because they are, in his estimation, capable of being produced intentionally. As such, chimpanzee gestures are highly significant to discussions of animal cognition and the evolution of human communication. This chapter challenges Tomasello's grounds for restricting this evolutionary novelty to the gestural modality. I argue that, in fact, recent evidence suggests that there is a significant functional difference between certain chimpanzee vocalizations and the vocal displays of other animals and that, based on Tomasello's own criteria for intentionality, gestures do not appear to have a monopoly on intentional communication in chimpanzees. Ultimately, this chapter aims to provide grounds for a multimodal account of the evolution of human communication. I conclude by suggesting that although there is reason to doubt that chimpanzees can communicate intentionally, there is no more reason to doubt this ability in the vocal modality than there is in the gestural modality.

22444820;pi200;Possible stages in the evolution of the language capacity;Jackendoff R;Journal Article;Much current discussion of the evolution of language has concerned the emergence of a stage in which single vocal or gestural signals were used symbolically. Assuming the existence of such a stage, the present review decomposes the emergence of modern language into nine partially ordered steps, each of which contributes to precision and variety of expression. Bickerton's proposed 'protolanguage' falls somewhere in the middle of this succession. In addition to the by-now accepted evidence from language learning, language disorders, and ape language experiments, modern languages provide evidence of these stages of evolution through the presence of detectable 'fossils' in vocabulary and grammar.

22444809;pi201;English language learning and learning academic language in mathematics;"Middleton J A; Llamas-Flores S; Guerra-Lombardi P P ";Book Chapter;While this chapter is ostensibly about the implications of research for helping English language learner (ELL) students learn more and better mathematics, its subtext is about developing a more cogent argument for adopting practices that better serve the needs of ELL populations. To do this requires that we digress slightly to examine the purposes language serves in our society, and to project that the problems we are facing today have as much to do with language as a means for belonging than it does with language as a means for communication of information. Following this digression, we jump into the research on ELLs, language acquisition, and their implications for learning the academic language of mathematics. On occasion we will distinguish 'school mathematics,' a rather constrained subset, from the larger discourse community of mathematicians and mathematically-proficient individuals. We do this because we see school in the United States as having its own norms related to mathematics that define only certain practices that would be considered legitimate by mathematicians as being 'legitimate' in the school context. Because immigrants and students who come from educational backgrounds and family contexts may bring different forms of representation, symbols and procedures that are perfectly correct and accepted in their culture of origin, these may not be accorded legitimacy in the eyes of the teacher or the testing system in the United States. Last, like other authors in this volume, we include gesture, writing, use of technology and other forms of knowledge representation and communication in our discussion of 'language' because these forms of expression have specific manifestations in mathematical discourse, and our goal is for students to develop coordinated systems of knowing, speaking and behaving that serve them well in their quest for happiness and prosperity.

22445720;pi203;The development of social understanding;"Carpendale J I M; Lewis C";Book Chapter;This chapter discusses the development of social understanding, emphasizing that understanding others is an essential aspect of being human. The authors review research and theory on the development of a range of skills constituting social understanding, beginning in infancy with gaze-following and gestures such as pointing. Given the importance attributed to false belief understanding in preschoolers, they review accounts of this development and criticisms of these accounts. Likewise, they discuss debates about claims of infants' understanding of false beliefs�claims that raise questions about the nature and origins of social awareness. The authors also discuss later-developing social skills that are still relatively neglected in the literature as well as contributions of neuroscience to the study of social cognitive development. Noting that there are many links between social cognition and children's social relations, the authors explicitly focus on the key role of language in social cognitive development. They also review ways in which social understanding may influence social conduct, issues of trust and deception, and cooperation and moral development. Throughout the chapter, the authors highlight ways that research traditions are influenced by worldviews or preconceptions about the nature of mind, meaning, and knowledge, and emphasize the interconnections between social understanding and all other aspects of human life.

22444873;pi204;Handedness for manual gestures in great apes: A meta-analysis;"Hopkins W D; Pika S; Liebal K; Bania A; Meguerditchian A; Gardner M; Schapiro S J ";Book Chapter;Left hemisphere dominance for language and speech is a prominent feature of the human brain. Some have suggested that left hemisphere lateralization for language in modern humans evolved from an existing lateralized system for gestural communication in the common ancestor of humans and apes. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of the data on handedness for manual gestures in great apes to test whether species-level asymmetries in hand use were evident and if these asymmetries were consistent across species. Hand preference data for manual gestures were summarized for published and unpublished data in the literature. For observational data, we found that bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans all showed group-level right handedness for manual gestures. For experimental data, group-level right handedness was only found for chimpanzees, though sample sizes were relatively small in the remaining ape species. When hand preference data were combined across ape species, we found that right handedness was much more prevalent for auditory gestures, such as CLAPPING, compared to visual and tactile gestures. The results support the view that asymmetries in hand use for gestural communication was prevalent in the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans and was possibly evident even earlier in primate evolution. Additional data are needed, particularly from wild apes to test for the presence of these asymmetries in subjects raised in their natural environment.

22445228;pi205;Facial-vocal displays, gestures and language;van Hooff J A ;Book Chapter;Animals possess nonverbal displays consisting of chemical signals, postures, gestures, calls, and, in mammals, of facial-vocal expressions, essentially reflecting intentions and attitudes of the sender. Humans, in addition, possess a verbal language with an 'unlimited' repertoire of referential and representational symbols, syntactically combined into meaningful complexes. Because of the vital role of speech the emancipation of vocal utterances in primates is seen as the beginning of linguistic evolution. However, in humans gesturing is closely associated with linguistic expression, favouring a gestural origin. Here I compare features of gesturing and facial-vocal expression in our primate relatives, e.g. referentiality and intentionality, contrasting these with linguistic performance. The conclusion is that a choice between one of the former as the main precursor of language cannot as yet be made.

22445141;pi206;From hand to mouth in the evolution of language: The influence of vocal behavior on lateralized hand use in manual gestures by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes);"Hopkins W; Cantero M";Journal Article;Examined the association between hand use for gestural communication and vocal behavior in chimpanzees. On each test trial, an experimenter approached the S's cage, positioned themselves approximately 1 m from the S's home cage and directly in front of the focal chimpanzee, and offered the S a banana. A 2nd experimenter, standing directly behind the experimenter offering the banana, recorded all communicative behavior of the focal S for a 1-minute sampling period. Each chimpanzee was tested on 10 separate occasions separated by at least 1 day. Results offer evidence that chimpanzees exhibit preferential use of the right hand in gestural communication. Moreover, use of the right hand in gestural communication is significantly enhanced when accompanied by a vocalization, particularly among human-reared chimpanzees. Taken together, the data suggest that the lateralization of manual and speech systems of communication may date back as far as 5 million years ago.

22445481;pi207;Is intuition embodied? A phenomenological study of clinical intuition in somatic psychotherapy practice;Tantia J F;Journal Article;Intuition in psychotherapy practice is often confused with terms such as emotional insight, body language, gut feeling and psychic ability. These terms generalise a common experience, yet do not adequately describe the lived experience of intuitive phenomena. This phenomenological study explored intuition in clinical practice from an embodied perspective based on two questions: (i) How, if at all, is intuition embodied? (ii) What is the role of non-verbal expressions while describing clinical intuitive phenomena? Purposive sampling was used to recruit somatic psychotherapists who claimed to experience intuition during clinical practice. An original methodology was created by synthesising a body-focused interview with descriptive analysis. Findings (i) challenged the current parameters of embodiment by expanding upon the experience of intuition beyond �gut feelings�, and (ii) suggested that gestures reveal implicit information regarding the ways in which intuition arrives into consciousness. Further studies are needed to investigate clinical phenomena from an embodied perspective, which could augment the value of somatic psychology practice and clarify the role of embodiment in traditional clinical practice for adjacent fields of psychology.

22444894;pi208;The functional origins of speech-related hand gestures;"Whishaw I; Sacrey L; Travis aS; Gholamrezaei G; Karl J";Journal Article;Many theories of language posit its recent evolution, perhaps contemporaneous with the evolution of Homo sapiens. The embodied language theory, however, in proposing that language includes gestures, provides an avenue for tracing language origins to phylogenetically earlier ancestral species. Here, evidence is presented that the structure of functional hand movements (e.g., reaching for food, climbing a ladder, or crawling), in rats and humans is similar. The structure of these functional hand movements is then compared to speech-related hand gestures in humans. The sequence of language-related gestures are also found to be characteristic of functional hand movements. It is suggested that these findings show that the arm and hand gestures that accompany human speech are derived from the same neural substrates that produce functional movements. Additionally, evidence is reviewed that supports the idea that speech-related gestures resemble the movements elicited by long-train stimulation of the primate motor cortex. Together, this evidence suggests that speech-related hand gestures have their evolutionary origins in functional hand movements of ancestral non-primate and primate species and may be constrained by the neural substrate for those movements. These findings are further discussed in relation to the idea that speech-related gestures reflect forelimb motor cortex contributions to embodied language.

22445669;pi210;A bottom-up approach to the primate mind;"de Waal F B M; Ferrari P F";Book Chapter;The study of of animal cognition traditionally focused on basic processes, such as classical conditioning, orientation, memory, imprinting, and the like, that applied to a wide range of species. Over the years, however, emphasis has shifted to a top-down view in which human accomplishments were placed at the top and the challenge was to find animals that could approach these. Not all scientists pursued this agenda, but it did come to dominate primate cognition studies, which as a result began to favor mentalistic cognitive accounts. We would take language, for example, to see how far apes could go with it. When attempts at teaching apes speech failed, training moved to the gestural domain, and performance exceeded expectations: symbolic communication appeared within grasp of our close relatives (Gardner and Gardner 1969). Definitions of language were quickly changed, however, stressing syntax over reference (Terrace 1979). This move may have kept the supposed species hierarchy intact, but it did little to illuminate basic capacities underlying symbolic communication and the relevance of these capacities for apes or other nonhuman animals. It is the latter type of questions�those concerning basic capacities�that should drive the study of animal cognition, not an obsession with rankings and the human-animal divide. What if we were to replace interest in complex cognition with an exploration of its foundation? Instead of asking which species can do X, the question would become how does X actually work? What are the necessary ingredients of X, and how did these evolve? Here we propose a bottom-up perspective that focuses on constituent capacities that underlie larger cognitive phenomena as to be expected from both neuroscience and evolutionary biology. We will briefly review recent research on episodic memory, planning, imitation, empathy, and prosocial behavior in order to show how complex capacities can often be broken down into components that humans share not just with the apes but with a host of other species. This approach, which has been gaining ground in the last few years, will move the field of comparative cognition toward an understanding of capacities in terms of underlying mechanisms, and the degree to which these mechanisms are either widespread or special adaptations.

22444837;pi211;Language and the mirror system: A perception/action based approach to communicative development;"Arbib M A; Oztop E; Zukow-Goldring P";Journal Article;"In answering 'What are the sources from outside the self that inform what the child knows?', our basic idea is that a shared understanding of action grounds what individuals know in common. In particular, we root the ontogeny of language in the progression from action and gesture to speech or signed language. What then might the evolutionary path to language and the ontogeny of language in the child have in common? We can characterize the source of the emergence of language in both as arising from perceiving and acting, leading to gesture, and eventually to speech or signed language. Rizzolatli & Arbib (1998) argue that the brain mechanisms underlying human language abilities evolved from our non-human primate ancestors' ability to link self-generated actions and the similar actions of others. On this view, communicative gestures emerged eventually from a shared understanding that actions one makes oneself are indeed similar to those made by conspecifics. Thus, what the self knows can be enriched by an understanding of the actions and aims of others, and vice versa. From this view, the origins of language reside in behaviors not originally related to communication. That is, this common understanding of action sequences may provide the 'missing link' to language. A corollary of this, not always sufficiently stressed, is that the full pattern of communication and understanding rests on a far richer set of brain functions than the core 'mirror system for grasping' said to be shared by monkey and human. We report here on the early stages of a research program designed to integrate empirical cross-cultural studies of infant communicative development (Zukow, 1990; Zukow-Goldring, 1996, 1997, 2001) with a computational approach to the mirror system in monkey, human and robot (Oztop & Arbib, 2002). We stress that mirror neurons are not innate but instead correspond to a repertoire of learned actions and learned methods for recognizing those actions. Our aim is an integrated view of how perceiving and acting ground the emergence of language. Our effort is to integrate analysis of the influences of the environment and, in particular, of the ways in which caregivers attune the child to that environment ('what the head is inside of [Mace, 1977]) with the study of the neural mechanisms that can learn from these attunements ('what is in the head'). We seek to delineate what children might 'know' from birth, and the interplay of perceptual processes 'with action that might allow them to come to know 'what everyone else already knows,' including word meaning.

22445142;pi212;Multisensory vocal communication in primates and the evolution of rhythmic speech;Ghazanfar A A ;Journal Article;The integration of the visual and auditory modalities during human speech perception is the default mode of speech processing. That is, visual speech perception is not a capacity that is 'piggybacked' on to auditory-only speech perception. Visual information from the mouth and other parts of the face is used by all perceivers to enhance auditory speech. This integration is ubiquitous and automatic and is similar across all individuals across all cultures. The two modalities seem to be integrated even at the earliest stages of human cognitive development. If multisensory speech is the default mode of perception, then this should be reflected in the evolution of vocal communication. The purpose of this review is to describe the data that reveal that human speech is not uniquely multisensory. In fact, the default mode of communication is multisensory in nonhuman primates as well but perhaps emerging with a different developmental trajectory. Speech production, however, exhibits a unique bimodal rhythmic structure in that both the acoustic output and the movements of the mouth are rhythmic and tightly correlated. This structure is absent inmost monkey vocalizations. One hypothesis is that the bimodal speech rhythm may have evolved through the rhythmic facial expressions of ancestral primates, as indicated by mounting comparative evidence focusing on the lip-smacking gesture.

We address this issue by examining the role of gestures and pictures as non-verbal supports for word learning in a novel (e.g. original/pretend) language in a sample of 62 preschoolers who differ in language abilities, language background, and gender. We tested children�s ability to learn novel words for familiar objects using a within-subjects design with three conditions: word-only; word + gesture; word + picture.

This paper provides a comprehensive review over the most recent developments in diverse scientific fields (e.g. biological anthropology, paleogenetics, cognitive neuroscience, functional neuroanatomy), in which essential insights regarding the origin of human language were gained in the last few years. This article discusses a series of aspects which presumably had a critical influence on the evolution of language. Particularly, our review points out the importance of neuroanatomical changes during the history of development of the hominins. Primarily, we emphasize the relevance of structural hemispheric asymmetries as well as cortico-cortical connectivities. With respect to the issue of the original modality of human language and the functional equivalent of language in non-human primates, respectively, our review of the evolutionary research on language stresses the perspective of a gestural instead of a vocal origin. In particular, the concept of 'mirror neurons' as the cerebral foundation of imitation and learning is meanwhile considered an important and indispensable part of a plausible model which builds on different previous explanatory approaches.

22445483;pi216;Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation of Broca's Area Affects Verbal Responses to Gesture Observation;"Gentilucci M; Bernardis P; Crisi G; Volta R";Journal Article;The aim of the present study was to determine whether Broca's area is involved in translating some aspects of arm gesture representations into mouth articulation gestures. In Experiment 1, we applied low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over Broca's area and over the symmetrical loci of the right hemisphere of participants responding verbally to communicative spoken words, to gestures, or to the simultaneous presentation of the two signals. We performed also sham stimulation over the left stimulation loci. In Experiment 2, we performed the same stimulations as in Experiment 1 to participants responding with words congruent and incongruent with gestures. After sham stimulation voicing parameters were enhanced when responding to communicative spoken words or to gestures as compared to a control condition of word reading. This effect increased when participants responded to the simultaneous presentation of both communicative signals. In contrast, voicing was interfered when the verbal responses were incongruent with gestures. The left stimulation neither induced enhancement on voicing parameters of words congruent with gestures nor interference on words incongruent with gestures. We interpreted the enhancement of the verbal response to gesturing in terms of intention to interact directly. Consequently, we proposed that Broca's area is involved in the process of translating into speech aspects concerning the social intention coded by the gesture. Moreover, we discussed the results in terms of evolution to support the theory [Corballis, M. C. (2002). From hand to mouth: The origins of language.

22445619;pi217;The ontogenetic ritualization of bonobo gestures;"Halina M; Rossano F; Tomasello M";Journal Article;Great apes communicate with gestures in flexible ways. Based on several lines of evidence, Tomasello and colleagues have posited that many of these gestures are learned via ontogenetic ritualization�a process of mutual anticipation in which particular social behaviors come to function as intentional communicative signals. Recently, Byrne and colleagues have argued that all great ape gestures are basically innate. In the current study, for the first time, we attempted to observe the process of ontogenetic ritualization as it unfolds over time. We focused on one communicative function between bonobo mothers and infants: initiation of 'carries' for joint travel. We observed 1,173 carries in ten mother�infant dyads. These were initiated by nine different gesture types, with mothers and infants using many different gestures in ways that reflected their different roles in the carry interaction. There was also a fair amount of variability among the different dyads, including one idiosyncratic gesture used by one infant. This gestural variation could not be attributed to sampling effects alone. These findings suggest that ontogenetic ritualization plays an important role in the origin of at least some great ape gestures.

However, we know little about how to scaffold children�s narrative skill. Here we examine whether the quality of kindergarten children�s narrative retellings depends on the kind of narrative elicitation they are given. We asked this question with respect to typically developing (TD) kindergarten children and children with pre- or perinatal unilateral brain injury (PL), a group that has been shown to have difficulty with narrative production. We compared children�s skill in retelling stories originally presented to them in 4 different elicitation formats: (a) wordless cartoons, (b) stories told by a narrator through the auditory modality, (c) stories told by a narrator through the audiovisual modality without co-speech gestures, and (e) stories told by a narrator in the audiovisual modality with co-speech gestures. We found that children told better structured narratives in response to the audiovisual + gesture elicitation format than in response to the other 3 elicitation formats, consistent with findings that co-speech gestures can scaffold other aspects of language and memory. The audiovisual + gesture elicitation format was particularly beneficial for children who had the most difficulty telling a well-structured narrative, a group that included children with larger lesions associated with cerebrovascular infarcts.

Combinatorial strategies used by all three apes revealed commonalities with child language, spoken and signed, at the two-year-old level. However, many differences were also observed: e.g., combinations made up a much smaller proportion and single symbols a much larger proportion of ape production compared with child production at a similar age; and ape combinations rarely exceeded three semiotic elements. The commonalties and differences among three sibling species highlight candidate combinatorial capacities that may underlie the evolution of human language.

This theory predicts that observation of speech-related lip movements or even listening to speech would result in effector and task specific increase of the excitability of the corresponding motor representations in the primary motor cortex (M1), since actual movement execution is known be effector and task specific. In addition, effector and task specific inhibitory control mechanisms should be important to prevent overt motor activation during observation of speech-related lip movements or listening to speech. We tested these predictions by applying focal transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left M1 of 12 healthy right-handed volunteers and measuring motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) in a lip muscle, the right orbicularis oris (OO), vs. a hand muscle, the right first dorsal interosseus (FDI). We found that MEP and SICI increased only in the OO but not in the FDI during viewing of speech-related lip movements or listening to speech. These changes were highly task specific because they were absent when lip movements non-related to speech were viewed. Finally, the increase in MEP amplitude in the OO correlated inversely with accuracy of speech perception, i.e. the MEP increase was directly related to task difficulty. The MEP findings support the notion that observation-execution matching is an operating process in the putative human MNS that might have been fundamental for evolution of language. Furthermore, the SICI findings provide evidence that inhibitory mechanisms are recruited to prevent unwanted overt motor activation during action observation.

22445562;pi221;Mira lo que te muestro: �Comunicaci�n referencial entre perros dom�sticos (Canis familiaris) y humanos?;"Jakovcevic A; Bentosela M";Journal Article;"Referential communication has been historically viewed as uniquely human because it is linked with the use of language. However, there is evidence indicating that animals can also communicate about external objects, by means of vocalizations or gestures. The use of gestures as pointing or gaze alternation involves the ability to direct the attention of an observer to a distal object or entity in the environment. This ability is shared with other species, especially those who live in captivity. For domestic dogs as for the species that live in captivity, humans provide the main resources for survival. For this reason a proper communication with them is essential. Visual social cues can be used to communicate emotional and mental states and so they allow us to predict other's behavior. In this context, both comprehension of the human gaze as well as the production of visual communicative signals by domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) have special relevance. The evidence reviewed in the present study indicate that dogs can detect cues associated with human attentional states as head orientation, behaving differently when the person remains attentive or inattentive. Also, they are able to follow human head direction to find hidden food in an object choice task, but not gaze direction. Moreover, dogs can direct human attention toward an out-of-reach object, alternating their own gaze between the human face and the target. On that basis, as dogs can detect, follow and direct human attention, it would be possible to suggest that they can referentially communicate with people about distal objects in the environment; however these capacities were principally observed in foraging contexts. Nevertheless this does not imply that dogs necessarily comprehend others as intentional beings. There are several hypotheses to explain the origin of these abilities in dogs, some postulate that the intense process of domestication to which them were submitted, provide them a special sensitivity to communicate with humans. Differently, others stress the importance of ontogeny. Although the domestication process would be essential for understanding dogs' ability to communicate with humans, the experience with people that they have throughout their lives is also involved in the acquisition of these skills. The two-stage hypothesis states that in addition to the domestication process, the sensitivity of a canid to human social cues depends on two types of ontogeny experience. First, interaction with humans during a sensitive developmental period leading to the acceptance of humans as social companions. Second, learning that is not restricted to a particular phase of development to utilize the location and movement of parts of the human body to locate sought-after objects. This would lead to a human-food association by conditioning processes. As domestic dogs spend most of their lives in human families, they have many opportunities to learn to use these signals. This hypothesis recognizes that the domestication of dogs provided a longer socialization period than that of other canids facilitating the acceptance of humans as social partners. However, the animal's contact with people during its ontogenetic development is essential, if this contact does not occur at the right time, communicative skills will not properly develop. Possibly, during thousands of years dogs have been learning to gaze at the human face as the shortest way to satisfy their needs. This gazing exchange thus became a privileged channel of communication between the two species.

A model of how a variety of neuronal regions in the monkey cortex interact to represent goal-directed actions has been developed. The model focuses on the interaction between the cortex of the superior temporal sulcus (STS), the anterior intraparietal area (AIP) and the premotor area F5. Recent human studies indicate that similar mirror neuron systems exist in the human brain. The location of the activated sites during observation in humans corresponds rather well to that of monkey areas containing neurons that selectively discharge during action observation. The data indicate that in primates there is a common fundamental ancient mechanism for action recognition. It is proposed that the mirror system for gesture/action recognition and imitation provides a necessary bridge to a small, fixed repertoire of a communicative gestural system. Mimetic communication not requiring speech production may be evolved from a basic mechanism that was not originally related to communication. It is speculated that the evolution of mimetic capacity was a necessary precursor to the evolution of human language.

22445642;pi226;Introduction: Is there a nonverbal period of development?;Rees E;Journal Article;Psychoanalysts have from the earliest days of our discipline been working to understand and articulate the place of language in mental life and therapeutic change. Words emerged from gestures and sounds relatively late in our evolutionary history, and in individual development spoken words emerge only after a time. Freud hypothesized that perceptual experiences are represented unconsciously as fragments of sensory experience that are associated with objects, things, in the physical world. Many psychoanalysts have been thinking about and experimenting with techniques that engage domains of mind and experience thought to be at least partly independent of language. Our discipline has been grappling with how to understand and use new information about the impact of relationships (old and new), the place of enactment, and the influence of gesture and of mirror neurons.

22445378;pi227;Neurobiology of vocal communication: Mechanisms for sensorimotor integration and vocal patterning;"Kelley D B; Bass A H ";Journal Article;This review will focus on recent developments in the sensorimotor integration of vocal communication. Two broad themes are emphasized: the evolution of vocal production and perception, and the role of social context. Advances include: a proposal for the emergence of vocal patterning during vertebrate evolution, the role of sensory mechanisms such as categorical perception in decoding communication signals, contributions of sensorimotor integration phenomena including mirror neurons and vocal learning, and mechanisms of hormone-dependent plasticity in both auditory and vocal systems. Transcriptional networks activated in humans but not in chimps by the FoxP2 gene suggest molecular mechanisms underlying vocal gestures and the emergence of human language.

The chapter is organized in four main parts. In the first part, a synthesis will present the most significant advances pertaining to the development of gestural communication in human infants and children. As the authors are interested in identifying lateralized patterns of manual gestures. Part 2 will be devoted to the description of manual asymmetries and their development during the first 2 years. Part 3 is concerned with the presentation of the properties of gestural communication in nonhuman primates. The fourth part deals with the question of the relationships between gestural communication, its lateralization and brain functioning. Finally, the authors will conclude by summarizing the main arguments that are relevant for advocating the crucial role played by gestures in the shaping of human communication and language in comparison to the vocal communicative system.

22445319;pi229;The tangle of space and time in human cognition;"Nunez R; Cooperrider K";Journal Article;Everyday concepts of duration, of sequence, and of past, present, and future are fundamental to how humans make sense of experience. In culture after culture, converging evidence from language, co-speech gesture, and behavioral tasks suggests that humans handle these elusive yet indispensable notions by construing them spatially. Where do these spatial construals come from and why do they take the particular, sometimes peculiar, spatial forms that they do? As researchers across the cognitive sciences pursue these questions on different levels�cultural, developmental�in diverse populations and with new methodologies, clear answers will depend upon a shared and nuanced set of theoretical distinctions. Time is not a monolith, but rather a mosaic of construals with distinct properties and origins.

First, the relation of sounds or sound patterns to meanings, things, actions, and relationships is not natural and given but rests on arbitrary convention. Second, the existence of gesturally represented patterns with the structure of simple sentences would have naturally let vocalizations habitually performed at the same time as these patterns become associated with the meanings of the gestural representations as well.

22445163;pi232;Multimodality in infancy: Vocal-motor and speech-gesture coordinations in typical and atypical development;Iverson J M ;Journal Article;From very early in life, expressive behavior is multimodal, with early behavioral coordinations being refined and strengthened over time as they become used for the communication of meaning. Of these communicative coordinations, those that involve gesture and speech have received perhaps the greatest empirical attention, but little is known about the developmental origins of the gesture-speech link. One possibility is that the origins of speech-gesture coordinations lie in hand-mouth linkages that are observed in the everyday sensorimotor activity of very young infants who do not yet use the hand or mouth to communicate meaning. In this article, I review evidence suggesting that the study of gesture-speech links and developmentally prior couplings between the vocal and motor systems in infancy can provide valuable insight into a number of later developments that reflect the cognitive interdependence of gesture and speech. These include aspects of language development and delay, the infant origins of the adult speech-gesture system, and early signs of autism spectrum disorder. Implications of these findings for studying the development of multimodal communication are considered.

22445654;pi233;Interactive state-transition diagrams for visualization of multimodal annotation;"Podlasov A; Tan S; O'Halloran K";Journal Article;Multimodal Analysis is a branch of Social Semiotics that studies how different resources, such as language, gesture, music, imagery, cinematography, etc. are used in modern media, and by humans in general, to construct and communicate meaning. Though theoretical aspects of multimodal analysis are well developed in the literature, and there is progress in the development of annotation software, the interpretation of annotated data still rarely uses algorithmic and data visualization approaches, limiting practical research in multimodal analysis. In the current work we propose how time stamped, tier-based multimodal annotations can be seen as finite state automatons and visualized as state-transition diagrams. We propose an algorithm converting time stamped annotation into a state-transition diagram and discuss how the resulting state-transition diagram can be visualized using freely available graph visualization tools. Then, we discuss common drawbacks of the existing tools, and propose an interactive visualization software tool allowing the analyst to synchronize the annotation state-transition diagram with the original media file. Finally, a case study on how the proposed visualization tools can assist media researchers in detecting patterns in multimodal analyses of news videos is presented.

The results show that if the recognition of gestures is not altered with age, the evolution of Alzheimer�s disease leads to a significant reduction in the ability to decode the meaning of gestures. We equally show that the quasi-linguistic gesture/pantomime dissociation seems irrelevant even if involved cognitive functions vary. Finally, we observe that even at an advanced stage of the disease, a priming of the response can improve the patients� productions. We conclude by discussing the interest of a communication centered on a non-verbal approach, both in a diagnostic field and in cognitive revalidation cases.

A subset of left hemisphere (LH) language areas activated when participants watched an audio-visual narrative in their mother tongue was activated when they observed a signed narrative. The inferior frontal (IFG) and precentral (Prec) gyri, the posterior parts of the planum temporale (pPT) and of the superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and the occipito-temporal junction (OTJ) were activated by both languages. The activity of these regions was not related to the presence of communicative intent because no such changes were observed when the non-signers watched a muted video of a spoken narrative. Recruitment was also not triggered by the linguistic structure of SL, because the areas, except pPT, were not activated when subjects listened to an unknown spoken language. The comparison of brain reactivity for spoken and sign languages shows that SL has a special status in the brain compared to speech; in contrast to unknown oral language, the neural correlates of SL overlap LH speech comprehension areas in non-signers. These results support the idea that strong relationships exist between areas involved in human action observation and language, suggesting that the observation of hand gestures have shaped the lexico-semantic language areas as proposed by the motor theory of speech. As a whole, the present results support the theory of a gestural origin of language.

22445466;pi236;The songbird auditory system;Woolley S M N ;Book Chapter;The songbird auditory system offers a unique opportunity lo investigate the role of auditory processing in vocal learning and communication. Vocal learning is defined here as imitating the vocalizations of others for communication. While all vertebrates have auditory systems, few use them for learned vocal communication because the ability lo learn vocal gestures is rare. Humans, some cetaceans, and three clades of birds (parrots, hummingbirds, and songbirds) are scientifically confirmed vocal learners. Other animals produce and perceive unlearned vocalizations. Currently, the songbird is the only animal model of auditory processing and perception in vocal learners. Extensive studies of songbird vocal behavior, including its dependence on learning, reveal numerous parallels between speech and birdsong. Examples include (I) developmental sensitive periods for vocal learning, (2) learning through imitation of adult models, (3) a dependence of vocal behavior on auditory feedback, (4) the use of unique vocal signals lo recognize individuals, and (5) lateralized vocalization processing in sensory and sensorimotor brain regions. Because of these parallels and the evolutionary conservation of auditory circuitry among vertebrates, our understanding of how the songbird auditory system encodes the information in vocal signals and decodes that information into social messages can provide valuable hypotheses for how human auditory processing forms the sensory foundation of speech.

22445284;pi239;Communicative intentions in wild chimpanzees: Persistence and elaboration in gestural signalling;"Roberts A; Vick S; Buchanan-Smith H ";Journal Article;"We examine evidence for communicative intent during conspecific interactions in wild chimpanzees (Budongo Forest, Uganda), focusing on persistence in gestural communication. Previous research indicates that great apes have large gestural repertoires and produce gestural communication in a flexible and intentional manner, including the production of gesture sequences. Although there is a lack of consensus on the form and function of sequences, there is some evidence that sequences are produced when signallers fail to receive any response from a recipient. Here, we provide first systematic evidence for communicative persistence in wild chimpanzees. Rather than examining only the presence or absence of a response, we used the most commonly observed response to assign meanings to gestures and examined sequence production in relation to response congruency. Chimpanzees ceased communication if successful, but persevered when unsuccessful. Chimpanzees repeated gestures when a response partially matched their goal but substituted the original gesture when a response was incongruent. Persistence was also mediated by recipient intent to respond, with more sequences produced within competitive than affiliative contexts. Gestures within sequences were homogenous in semantic meaning and signallers continued until the response matched the assigned meaning of the initial gesture. Gestural sequence production was not primarily affective; gesture intensity (in terms of modality) did not increase within sequences. Chimpanzee gestural sequences emerged to achieve specific outcomes; given variability in recipient behaviour following initial gestures, signallers were flexible in their persistence towards these goals.

The present study experimentally tests this question by having pairs of participants communicate a range of pre-specified items (emotions, actions, objects) over a series of trials to a partner using either non-linguistic vocalization, gesture or a combination of the two. Gesture-alone outperformed vocalization-alone, both in terms of successful communication and in terms of the creation of an inventory of sign-meaning mappings shared within a dyad (i.e., sign alignment). Combining vocalization with gesture did not improve performance beyond gesture-alone. In fact, for action items, gesture-alone was a more successful means of communication than the combined modalities. When people do not share a system for communication they can quickly create one, and gesture is the best means of doing so.

In the original article, the author Hugo Hurquina's name was spelled incorrectly. It should read Hugo Urquina.] Human communication in a natural context implies the dynamic coordination of contextual clues, paralinguistic information and literal as well as figurative language use. In the present study we constructed a paradigm with four types of video clips: literal and metaphorical expressions accompanied by congruent and incongruent gesture actions. Participants were instructed to classify the gesture accompanying the expression as congruent or incongruent by pressing two different keys while electrophysiological activity was being recorded. We compared behavioral measures and event related potential (ERP) differences triggered by the gesture stroke onset. Accuracy data showed that incongruent metaphorical expressions were more difficult to classify. Reaction times were modulated by incongruent gestures, by metaphorical expressions and by a gesture�expression interaction. No behavioral differences were found between the literal and metaphorical expressions when the gesture was congruent. N400-like and LPC-like (late positive complex) components from metaphorical expressions produced greater negativity. The N400-like modulation of metaphorical expressions showed a greater difference between congruent and incongruent categories over the left anterior region, compared with the literal expressions. More importantly, the literal congruent as well as the metaphorical congruent categories did not show any difference. Accuracy, reaction times and ERPs provide convergent support for a greater contextual sensitivity of the metaphorical expressions.

22444933;pi247;The development of multimodal explanations in French children;"Colletta J M; Pellenq C";Book Chapter;In this chapter, we focus on the development of explanatory abilities in French children attending nursery school and grade school. Even if young children are unable to produce written explanatory texts, there is nothing to stop them from formulating oral explanations. It is the 'why' type of explanation that we intend to examine here and, more specifically, the way it develops with age. Furthermore, since speech acts are multimodal, children's explanatory verbal productions are frequently accompanied by bodily movements (hand and head gestures, facial expressions, changes of posture). The observation of gesture associated with speech provides data of considerable interest to anyone in the field of discourse development and the evolution of abstract thought. In the first section, 'Discourse Development and Explanatory Abilities in Speech,' we begin by defending the idea that the study of the way in which explanations develop is a valuable starting point in gaining an understanding of how children come to master the academic (i.e., monologic) uses of discourse. In the next section, 'Monologic Discourse and Gesture Development,' we report certain data that shed light on the importance of gesture in spoken communication as well as other data that suggest that the gestural system associated with speech undergoes an undeniable development. In the third section, we document the methodological choices made for the study that underlie the results and analyses presented in this chapter. This comparative study consists of two facets, one relating to the explanatory behavior of children aged 6 to 11 years and the other relating to the equivalent behavior in younger children aged 3 to 6 years. In the fourth section on the development of explanatory abilities in French children, we present the most significant results of this study, showing that spoken explanations are more complex in older children than in younger ones. These results argue in favor of the idea that the ability to verbalize monologic explanations develops with age. The gestural aspects of children's explanations are discussed in the remaining sections. It would appear that gestures relating to abstract dimensions and discourse cohesion are most prominent among the gestures that accompany the explanations produced by children aged 6 years and older (fifth section). While the utilization of such gestures is well documented in adults, their high rate in this corpus may seem surprising. Nevertheless, a semiotic analysis of these gestures reveals that they are based on the same properties as those observed in adults: abstract pointing and spatial metaphors (sixth section). In contrast, a comparison with the gestures produced by younger children indicates that they are practically absent in the latter. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the gestural system associated with speech develops through childhood (seventh section). The conclusion proposes a summary of this set of observations and results and addresses the implications both for explanatory development and, more generally, for language and cognitive development.

Consortship represented the dominant context for the use of gestural communication by adult males in the Sonso community. Gesturing provided consorting males with the opportunity to communicate their intentions to the female, while avoiding the risk of also advertising these to other community males.

22444992;pi250;Gestures of apes and pre-linguistic human children: Similar or different?;Pika S;Journal Article;The majority of studies on animal communication provide evidence that gestural signalling plays an important role in the communication of non-human primates and resembles that of pre-linguistic and just-linguistic human infants in some important ways. However, ape gestures also differ from the gestures of human infants in some important ways, and these differences might provide crucial clues for answering the question of how human language -- at least in its cognitive and social-cognitive aspects -- evolved from the gestural communication of our ape-like ancestors. This article provides an overview on the gestural signalling of monkeys and apes to enable a comparison with gestures in pre- or just-linguistic children. Implications for the evolution of language are discussed.

22444899;pi251;Unseen facial and bodily expressions trigger fast emotional reactions;"Tamietto M; Castelli L; Vighetti S; Perozzo P; Geminiani G; Weiskrantz L; de Gelder B";Journal Article;The spontaneous tendency to synchronize our facial expressions with those of others is often termed emotional contagion. It is unclear, however, whether emotional contagion depends on visual awareness of the eliciting stimulus and which processes underlie the unfolding of expressive reactions in the observer. It has been suggested either that emotional contagion is driven by motor imitation (i.e., mimicry), or that it is one observable aspect of the emotional state arising when we see the corresponding emotion in others. Emotional contagion reactions to different classes of consciously seen and 'unseen' stimuli were compared by presenting pictures of facial or bodily expressions either to the intact or blind visual field of two patients with unilateral destruction of the visual cortex and ensuing phenomenal blindness. Facial reactions were recorded using electromyography, and arousal responses were measured with pupil dilatation. Passive exposure to unseen expressions evoked faster facial reactions and higher arousal compared with seen stimuli, therefore indicating that emotional contagion occurs also when the triggering stimulus cannot be consciously perceived because of cortical blindness. Furthermore, stimuli that are very different in their visual characteristics, such as facial and bodily gestures, induced highly similar expressive responses. This shows that the patients did not simply imitate the motor pattern observed in the stimuli, but resonated to their affective meaning. Emotional contagion thus represents an instance of truly affective reactions that may be mediated by visual pathways of old evolutionary origin bypassing cortical vision while still providing a cornerstone for emotion communication and affect sharing.

22444979;pi252;Origins of the human pointing gesture: A training study;"Matthews D; Behne T; Lieven E; Tomasello M";Journal Article;Despite its importance in the development of children�s skills of social cognition and communication, very little is known about the ontogenetic origins of the pointing gesture. We report a training study in which mothers gave children one month of extra daily experience with pointing as compared with a control group who had extra experience with musical activities. One hundred and two infants of 9, 10, or 11 months of age were seen at the beginning, middle, and end of this one-month period and tested for declarative pointing and gaze following. Infants� ability to point with the index finger at the end of the study was not affected by the training but was instead predicted by infants� prior ability to follow the gaze direction of an adult. The frequency with which infants pointed indexically was also affected by infant gaze following ability and, in addition, by maternal pointing frequency in free play, but not by training. In contrast, infants� ability to monitor their partner�s gaze when pointing, and the frequency with which they did so, was affected by both training and maternal pointing frequency in free play. These results suggest that prior social cognitive advances, rather than adult socialization of pointing per se, determine the developmental onset of indexical pointing, but socialization processes such as imitation and adult shaping subsequently affect both infants� ability to monitor their interlocutor�s gaze while they point and how frequently infants choose to point.

In the first part of the analysis, communication was mainly at a nonverbal level, via gestures, body movements, gaze, long silences and the coded language of dreams without associations. The importance of listening is stressed, including a 'hearing with eyes,' in order to attune to presymbolic levels of the patient's psychic organization and to gather preverbal elements of her subjective expression. The analytic device is considered as a transformation system through which unconscious somatopsychic processes�sensorial, emotional and protomental states�acquire the quality of representability. In the final phase of the analysis, thanks to her acquired capacity to narrate, relive and work through what had been enacted in the relationship and what had been discarded, repeated and transformed in dreams, the patient succeeded in revealing and signifying her internal experience in the context of the transference. The author is confident that the introjection of the analytic experience and the elaboration of the separation from the analyst will further modify, in the post-analysis, the traumatic memory of the death of the patient's mother, which is repeated in the transference at the end of the analysis.

Reports of success on human guided tasks have led to evolutionary hypotheses that set dogs� skills apart from other species, including other canids, in terms of their social cognition and comprehension of human communicative stimuli. However, until recently the range of other species tested and the availability of studies using equivalent testing methods between different species and groups have been limited, making it difficult to interpret cross-species comparisons. Here we demonstrate that human-socialized wolves are not only capable of responding to points made with the arm and hand, but are sensitive to a wide range of human gestures when given the opportunity to utilize such gestures in an object-choice task. Claims that domestic dogs are unique in their ability to respond to diverse novel stimuli may be in part due to the absence of data for the same range of gestures in other species. We also provide the first evidence that human-socialized coyotes have the capacity to utilize a human point to locate a target; further demonstrating that domestication is not a prerequisite for canid responsiveness to human actions, and that socialization and life experience are likely more important predictors of success.

22445491;pi256;Mirror neurons and evolution of communication and language;"Fogassi L; Ferrari P F";Book Chapter;There are different theories about language evolution. Some authors claim that language (and speech) evolved from monkey vocalization. Others claim that language/communicative behavior stems from gestural communication. Some even deny a direct evolution of language from some monkey precursor, considering the former as a completely new acquisition of the human species, with characteristics that are entirely different from any other animal cognitive function. Recently, this view has been partially modified. It has been suggested that the human faculty of language can be separated into a broad sense faculty (FLB) and a narrow sense faculty (FLN). FLB includes a sensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system and an internal computational system (narrow syntax) for recursion that 'takes a finite set of elements and yields a potential infinite array of discrete expressions'. Although there is no direct evidence for the emergence of human language from nonhuman primate precursors, we argue that there are several empirical observations coming from different research fields (i.e., neuroscience, ethology, pycholinguistics, comparative anatomy) pointing to a commonality between nonhuman primate communication and the properties of human language. In this chapter, we will focus on the possible neurophysiological mechanisms and behavioral processes that might have formed the basis of the evolution of a vocal communicative system as complex as human speech.

22445719;pi257;Speech-independent production of communicative gestures: Evidence from patients with complete callosal disconnection;"Lausberg H; Zaidel E; Cruz R; Ptito A";Journal Article;Recent neuropsychological, psycholinguistic, and evolutionary theories on language and gesture associate communicative gesture production exclusively with left hemisphere language production. An argument for this approach is the finding that right-handers with left hemisphere language dominance prefer the right hand for communicative gestures. However, several studies have reported distinct patterns of hand preferences for different gesture types, such as deictics, batons, or physiographs, and this calls for an alternative hypothesis. We investigated hand preference and gesture types in spontaneous gesticulation during three semi-standardized interviews of three right-handed patients and one left-handed patient with complete callosal disconnection, all with left hemisphere dominance for praxis. Three of them, with left hemisphere language dominance, exhibited a reliable left-hand preference for spontaneous communicative gestures despite their left hand agraphia and apraxia. The fourth patient, with presumed bihemispheric language representation, revealed a consistent right-hand preference for gestures. All four patients displayed batons, tosses, and shrugs more often with the left hand/shoulder, but exhibited a right hand preference for pantomime gestures. We conclude that the hand preference for certain gesture types cannot be predicted by hemispheric dominance for language or by handedness. We found distinct hand preferences for specific gesture types. This suggests a conceptual specificity of the left and right hand gestures.We propose that left hand gestures are related to specialized right hemisphere functions, such as prosody or emotion, and that they are generated independently of left hemisphere language production. Our findings challenge the traditional neuropsychological and psycholinguistic view on communicative gesture production.

22445693;pi258;Mandrill visual gestures: A round-the-world study of the largest of all monkeys;Laidre M E ;Book Chapter;Apes have rich gestural communication systems. But do monkeys? If so, what forms and functions do monkey gestures have, and how does the relationship between form and function originate developmentally? This chapter reports intensive observations aimed at answering these questions in the largest of all monkeys, the mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx). Nearly thirty captive mandrill groups distributed across three continents were studied over the course of a decade, some groups for three consecutive generations. Mandrills performed three visual gestures: SLAP GROUND, HAND EXTENSION, and EYE COVERING. While SLAP GROUND was distributed uniformly across individuals and groups, HAND EXTENSION and EYE COVERING�the two focal gestures of this chapter�showed restricted distributions that were consistent with their being learned rather than instinctive. Contrasting HAND EXTENSION against EYE COVERING for fifteen different signal parameters revealed that these two gestures had antithetical forms and functions but had similar developmental histories. Within each gesture the close correspondence between form and function suggested that ontogenetic ritualization contributed to both HAND EXTENSION'S and EYE COVERING'S origin. Furthermore, for EYE COVERING the clustering of all known performers within a single group suggested this gesture was culturally transmitted. Broadly, these results suggest that multiple interacting factors, including instinct, learning, and culture may contribute to the emergence of monkey gestures. Follow-up experiments, however, remain critical for rigorously testing the developmental origins and potential cultural transmission of non-human gestures.

Following recent studies that focused on (a) language and discursive practice and (b) the pragmatics of communication that draws on talk, gestures, and semiotic resources in the setting, we propose a redefinition of the nature of conception. Conceptions are understood as the dialectical relation of simultaneously available speech, gestures, and contextual structures that cannot be reduced to verbal rendering because gestures and contextual structures constitute different modalities in the communication. Drawing on data collected during a physics unit about gas taught in French tenth grade classrooms, we show why an appropriate account of conceptions requires: (a) gestures simultaneously produced with talk; and (b) identification of the relevant structures in the setting used by the participants as meaning-making (semiotic) resources. We propose to: (a) reconceptualize the notion of conception as consisting of a dialectical unit of all relevant semiotic (meaning-making) resources publicly made available by a speaker (talk, gesture, context); and (b) consider conceptual change through the temporal evolution of the dialectical unit defined in this manner.

This paper briefly explores some evolutionary implications of a range of closely related impairments of speech, language and gesture arising from left frontal brain lesions. I discuss aphasic lexical speech automatisms (LSAs) and their resolution with some recovery into agrammatism with apraxia of speech, an impairment of speech planning and programming. I focus attention on the most common forms of LSAs, expletives and the pronoun+modal/aux subtype, and propose that further research into these phenomena can contribute to the debate. I briefly discuss recent studies of progressively degenerating neurological conditions resulting in progressive patterns of cognitive impairments that promises to provide insight into the evolutionary relationships between speech, language and gesture.

22445069;pi262;The Mirror System Hypothesis: how did protolanguage evolve?;Arbib M;Book Chapter;"We ask: how much of language rests on brain mechanisms that evolved specifically to serve language, and how much rests on human 'inventions' that exploited brain mechanisms that evolved for other purposes? The present chapter offers an evolutionary framework for language which relates it to the brain mechanisms for action and perception that we share with other primates. Let us define a protolanguage as a system of utterances used by a particular hominid species (possibly including Homo sapiens) which we may recognize as a precursor to human language, but which is not itself a human language in the modern sense. The approach offered here extends the Mirror System Hypothesis of Rizzolatti and Arbib (1998) and provides a neurological basis for the claim (e.g. Hewes 1973; Stokoe 2001) that hominids had a (proto)language based primarily on manual gestures before they had a (proto)language based primarily on vocal gestures. However, this claim remains controversial and one may contrast two extreme views on the matter: (i) Language evolved directly as speech (MacNeilage 1998). (ii) Language evolved first as signed language (i.e. as a full language, not protolanguage) and then speech emerged from this basis in manual communication (Stokoe 2001). My approach is closer to (ii) than to (i). I shall argue that our distant ancestors (for example, Homo habilis through to early Homo sapiens) had a protolanguage based extensively on manual gestures ('protosign') which--contra (i)--provided essential scaffolding for the emergence of a protolanguage based primarily on vocal gestures ('protospeech'), but that the hominid line saw advances in both protosign and protospeech feeding off each other in an expanding spiral so that--contra (ii)--protosign did not attain the status of a full language prior to the emergence of early forms of protospeech. I will use the term language readiness for those properties of the brain that provide the capacity to acquire and use language. Then the hypothesis offered here is that the 'language-ready brain' of the first Homo sapiens supported basic forms of gestural and vocal communication (protosign and protospeech) but not the rich syntax and compositional semantics and accompanying conceptual structures that underlie modern human languages.

The main hypothesis is that the output systems of speech and gesture may draw on underlying brain mechanisms common to both language and motor functions. We analyze the spontaneous interaction with their parents of three typically-developing children (2 M, 1 F) videotaped monthly at home between 10 and 23 months of age. Data analyses focused on the production of actions, representational and deictic gestures and words, and gesture-word combinations. Results indicate that there is a continuity between the production of the first action schemes, the first gestures and the first words produced by children. The relationship between gestures and words changes over time. The onset of two-word speech was preceded by the emergence of gesture-word combinations. The results are discussed in order to integrate and support the evolutionary and neurophysiological views of language origins and development.

22445504;pi266;The neuroscience of emotion in music;"Panksepp J; Trevarthen C";Book Chapter;Music moves us. Its rhythms can make our bodies dance and its tones and melodies can stir emotions. It brings life to solitary thoughts and memories, can comfort and relieve loneliness, promote private or shared happiness, and engender feelings of deep sadness and loss. The sounds of music communicate emotions vividly in ways beyond the ability of words and most other forms of art. It can draw us together in affectionate intimacy, as in the first prosodic song-like conversations between mothers and infants. It can carry the volatile emotions of human attachments and disputes in folk songs and grand opera, and excite the passions of crowds on great social occasions. These facts challenge contemporary cognitive and neural sciences. The psychobiology of music invites neuroscientists who study the emotional brain to unravel the neural nature of affective experience, and to seek entirely new visions of how the mind generates learning and memory�to reveal the nature of 'meaning'. The science of communicative musicality�the dynamic forms and functions of bodily and vocal gestures�helps us enquire how the motivating impulses of music can tell compelling stories. This also leads us to ask how human music relates to our animal emotional heritage and the dynamic instinctual movements that communicate emotions. Research on the emotional systems of animals is bringing us closer to explanations of the still mysterious aspects of human affective experiences, and hence the emotional power of music. With the aid of animal research on these emotional systems and how they interact with our cognitive abilities, we may find a new view of communicative musicality as a form of playful and endlessly inventive social behaviour that helps build, epigenetically, the social brains of our children, to facilitate mental and physical health and learning permeated by prosocial affects (Panksepp 2001, 2007b). We review the evidence that the emotions of animals, their neurochemical basis and the body movements and vocalizations by which they are expressed, may reveal the deep sources of musical feeling in human beings. They help explain how music supports our social life, and how our musical preferences can define our 'identity' in society. We relate the comparative neuroscience of emotions to the rhythmic musicality of mother-infant communication. By considering the effects of brain injuries and genetic disorders in childrens' brain development, we conclude that the acquired cognitive appreciation of music depends upon subcortical emotional systems that uniquely engage the cerebral hemispheres. We note the teaching and healing powers of music, and relate communication of emotions in music to motives for cultural learning, especially to the evolution of language acquisition.

22445262;pi267;Potential role of monkey inferior parietal neurons coding action semantic equivalences as precursors of parts of speech;"Yamazaki Y; Yokochi H; Tanaka M; Okanoya K; Iriki A";Journal Article;The anterior portion of the inferior parietal cortex possesses comprehensive representations of actions embedded in behavioural contexts. Mirror neurons, which respond to both self-executed and observed actions, exist in this brain region in addition to those originally found in the premotor cortex. We found that parietal mirror neurons responded differentially to identical actions embedded in different contexts. Another type of parietal mirror neuron represents an inverse and complementary property of responding equally to dissimilar actions made by itself and others for an identical purpose. Here, we propose a hypothesis that these sets of inferior parietal neurons constitute a neural basis for encoding the semantic equivalence of various actions across different agents and contexts. The neurons have mirror neuron properties, and they encoded generalization of agents, differentiation of outcomes, and categorization of actions that led to common functions. By integrating the activities of these mirror neurons with various codings, we further suggest that in the ancestral primates� brains, these various representations of meaningful action led to the gradual establishment of equivalence relations among the different types of actions, by sharing common action semantics. Such differential codings of the components of actions might represent precursors to the parts of protolanguage, such as gestural communication, which are shared among various members of a society. Finally, we suggest that the inferior parietal cortex serves as an interface between this action semantics system and other higher semantic systems, through common structures of action representation that mimic language syntax.

22445327;pi269;A baby's 'broken bridge' to the parents;Magagna J;Book Chapter;When a baby-mother/father relationship works, the baby keeps alive the desire to communicate with the parents through eyes, mouth, hands, body, and mind. The desire to be perceived and fully understood by his parents becomes a passionate one as the baby falls more deeply in love with his parents. He moves from crying to pointing to speaking and symbolically playing out his experiences as part of an intense wish to share emotional experiences and interests with them. Unfortunately, pre-verbal relationships with the parents do not work for every baby, and the emotional bridge connecting the baby to his parents is sometimes broken. When this happens, a basic fault (Balint, 1968) occurs in the development of his personality. When faced with an emotional crisis at a later point in his life, the child will then be at risk of regression to not-talking, not-eating, and not being open to anything the parents have to offer him. In infancy, when the emotional bridge to the parents is damaged or broken, the infant is desperate and tries to find a way of coping with the fear of dying, the anxieties regarding emotional disintegration, and the pain of being left alone. In early infancy, the baby lacks the inner capacities to bear such emotional experiences. Deprived of parents who are sufficiently responsive to his own particular needs, the baby turns to self-protection for safety. Not-thinking (Emanuel, 2001), often referred to as dissociation, becomes frequently resorted to as a primitive protection. Other primitive protections also develop as ways to keep the baby away from the risk of being vulnerable through needing parents who are not available to help him. In order to facilitate the therapist's and parents' verbal greeting of gestures (Magagna, Chapter Seven) of a non-speaking young person in family or individual psychotherapy, I am going to describe the first year in the life of an infant whose emotional bridge to the mother is being broken in the pre-verbal stages of his development. This baby's broken bridge to the mother contributed to his lack of desire to reach out to his mother through vocalising, gesturing, forming words, and speaking. His personality was thus at risk of regression to the basic fault in his personality structure at times of developmental crises (Balint, 1968). I will also look at the possible origins of the problem in mother's or father's past, and see how a series of weekly infant observation sessions, and later participant observation sessions, were able to help the family towards a healthier, happier future.

22445397;pi270;From manual gesture to speech: A gradual transition;"Gentilucci M; Corballis M C ";Journal Article;There are a number of reasons to suppose that language evolved from manual gestures. We review evidence that the transition from primarily manual to primarily vocal language was a gradual process, and is best understood if it is supposed that speech itself a gestural system rather than an acoustic system, an idea captured by the motor theory of speech perception and articulatory phonology. Studies of primate premotor cortex, and, in particular, of the so-called 'mirror system' suggest a double hand/mouth command system that may have evolved initially in the context of ingestion, and later formed a platform for combined manual and vocal communication. In humans, speech is typically accompanied by manual gesture, speech production itself is influenced by executing or observing hand movements, and manual actions also play an important role in the development of speech, from the babbling stage onwards. The final stage at which speech became relatively autonomous may have occurred late in hominid evolution, perhaps with a mutation of the FOXP2 gene around 100,000 years ago.

23080817;pi273;Cues on the origin of language: From electrophysiological data on mirror neurons and motor representations;"Fadiga L; Craighero L";Book Chapter;Fadiga and Craighero afford cues to the origin of language based on electrophysiological data on mirror neurons and motor representations. They inter alia report Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) data on how a system in humans motorically 'resonates' when they listen to speech. Their current research is aimed at investigating if and how, during speech listening, tongue motor representations are activated in the listener as expression of an acoustically evoked motor resonance, and as to whether such activation has a role in the perception of speech. According to Liberman's motor theory of speech perception, speech is perceived by matching articulatory gestures, embedded in listened words, on the listener's motor repertoire, entailing that perception and production of speech use a common repertoire of motor primitives represented in the brain as invariant motor commands. Recently this theory has been indirectly supported by a series of neurophysiological data. Brain imaging studies and electrophysiological investigations of motor cortex excitability show that in humans the observation of motor actions activates the motor circuits involved in the generation of the seen movements. Among active areas, the presence of Broca's region suggests a possible evolutionary pathway linking hand action related mirror system to the birth of spoken language. Fadiga and Craighero point to the homology between this newly discovered visuo-motor mechanism and the acoustic/motor matching postulated by the motor theory of speech perception, opening fruitful windows.

22445516;pi274;From action to discourse: The bridging function of gestures;"Roth W M; Ziemke T";Journal Article;"Gestures are pervasive in human communication across cultures; they clearly constitute an embodied aspect of cognition. In this study, evidence is provided for the contention that gestures are not only a co-expression of meaning in a different modality but also constitute an important stepping stone in the evolution of discourse. Data are provided from a Grade 10 physics course where students learned about electrostatics by doing investigations for which they constructed explanations. The data show that iconic gestures (i.e. symbolic hand movements) arise from the manipulation of objects (ergotic hand movements) and sensing activity (epistemic hand movements). Gestures not only precede but also support the emergence of scientific language. School science classes turn out to be ideal laboratories for studying the evolution of domain ontologies and (scientific) language. Micro-analytic studies of gesture-speech relationships and their emergence can therefore serve as positive constraints and test beds for synthetic models of language emergence.

22445143;pi275;Dynamics of large-scale cortical interactions at high gamma frequencies during word production: Event related causality (ERC) analysis of human electrocorticography (ECoG);"Korzeniewska A; Franaszczuk P; Crainiceanu C; Kus R; Crone N";Journal Article;Intracranial EEG studies in humans have shown that functional brain activation in a variety of functional�anatomic domains of human cortex is associated with an increase in power at a broad range of high gamma (>60 Hz) frequencies. Although these electrophysiological responses are highly specific for the location and timing of cortical processing and in animal recordings are highly correlated with increased population firing rates, there has been little direct empirical evidence for causal interactions between different recording sites at high gamma frequencies. Such causal interactions are hypothesized to occur during cognitive tasks that activate multiple brain regions. To determine whether such causal interactions occur at high gamma frequencies and to investigate their functional significance, we used event-related causality (ERC) analysis to estimate the dynamics, directionality, and magnitude of event-related causal interactions using subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) recorded during two word production tasks: picture naming and auditory word repetition. A clinical subject who had normal hearing but was skilled in American Signed Language (ASL) provided a unique opportunity to test our hypothesis with reference to a predictable pattern of causal interactions, i.e. that language cortex interacts with different areas of sensorimotor cortex during spoken vs. signed responses. Our ERC analyses confirmed this prediction. During word production with spoken responses, perisylvian language sites had prominent causal interactions with mouth/tongue areas of motor cortex, and when responses were gestured in sign language, the most prominent interactions involved hand and arm areas of motor cortex. Furthermore, we found that the sites from which the most numerous and prominent causal interactions originated, i.e. sites with a pattern of ERC 'divergence', were also sites where high gamma power increases were most prominent and where electrocortical stimulation mapping interfered with word production. These findings suggest that the number, strength and directionality of event-related causal interactions may help identify network nodes that are not only activated by a task but are critical to its performance.

The present paper will examine the subhypothesis that protosign (S5) formed a scaffolding for protospeech (S6), but that the two interacted with each other in supporting the evolution of brain and body that made Homo sapiens 'language-ready'.

22445653;pi279;2 + 2 Linguistic minimal frames: For a language evolutionary framework;Abry C;Book Chapter;This chapter addresses the core questions of human language's specificity and minimal structure from the perspective of the linguist. He develops an integrative framework for the study of language evolution, redefining the primitive notions of phonology, morphology and syntax, as viewed in a cross-modal approach, with arguments from the study of language development, the study of sign language, and especially of the supposedly minimal sign language ABSL (Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language), as well as the study of neurophysiology and linguistic typology. The author proposes to view the emergence of language as the progressive construction of four framing structures, built up on articulatory and manual gestural elements, and attention-grabbing and attention-sharing capacities, not simply as a deployable Hte-scopic antenna, or even a set of Russian nesting dolls: [[[[the Syllable frame] the Foot frame] the Predicative frame] the Narrative frame]. But rather like a double coupling chemical reaction, i.e. in a too simplistic embedding notation: [[[Babble], [[Predicate] Tell]] Point].

22445737;pi282;The role of human body movements in mate selection;"Hugill N; Fink B; Neave N";Journal Article;It is common scientific knowledge, that most of what we say within a conversation is not only expressed by the words� meaning alone, but also through our gestures, postures, and body movements. This non-verbal mode is possibly rooted firmly in our human evolutionary heritage, and as such, some scientists argue that it serves as a fundamental assessment and expression tool for our inner qualities. Studies of nonverbal communication have established that a universal, culture-free, non-verbal sign system exists, that is available to all individuals for negotiating social encounters. Thus, it is not only the kind of gestures and expressions humans use in social communication, but also the way these movements are performed, as this seems to convey key information about an individual�s quality. Dance, for example, is a special form of movement, which can be observed in human courtship displays. Recent research suggests that people are sensitive to the variation in dance movements, and that dance performance provides information about an individual�s mate quality in terms of health and strength. This article reviews the role of body movement in human non-verbal communication, and highlights its significance in human mate preferences in order to promote future work in this research area within the evolutionary psychology framework.

22445675;pi283;Postcards from the mind: The relationship between speech, imagistic gesture, and thought;de Ruiter J P;Journal Article;In this paper, I compare three different assumptions about the relationship between speech, thought and gesture. These assumptions have profound consequences for theories about the representations and processing involved in gesture and speech production. I associate these assumptions with three simplified processing architectures. In the Window Architecture, gesture provides us with a 'window into the mind'. In the Language Architecture, properties of language have an influence on gesture. In the Postcard Architecture, gesture and speech are planned by a single process to become one multimodal message. The popular Window Architecture is based on the assumption that gestures come, as it were, straight out of the mind. I argue that during the creation of overt imagistic gestures, many processes, especially those related to (a) recipient design, and (b) effects of language structure, cause an observable gesture to be very different from the original thought that it expresses. The Language Architecture and the Postcard Architecture differ from the Window Architecture in that they both incorporate a central component which plans gesture and speech together, however they differ from each other in the way they align gesture and speech. The Postcard Architecture assumes that the process creating a multimodal message involving both gesture and speech has access to the concepts that are available in speech, while the Language Architecture relies on interprocess communication to resolve potential conflicts between the content of gesture and speech.

23080789;pi284;What do students do in a F2F CSCL classroom? The optimization of multiple communications modes;"Chen W; Looi C; Tan S";Journal Article;This exploratory study analyzes how students use different communication modes to share information, negotiate meaning and construct knowledge in the process of doing a group learning activity in a Primary Grade 5 blended learning environment in Singapore. Small groups of students interacted face-to-face over a computer-mediated communication (CMC) technology called Group Scribbles (GS) to jointly complete a learning task. The lesson designers attempted to optimize the use of CMC technology and face-to-face (F2F) discussion in students� collaborative learning, with the aim of harnessing the specific features of each medium. Building on notions from communication studies and from interaction analysis, we observed the construction and evolution of the interactions through analyzing the artifacts that were produced by a group of students�in verbal talk, gestures, and sketches drawn and text inscribed in GS. F2F and GS interactions intertwined to support collaborative learning. The findings from this study could inform design aspects concerning integrating and reinforcing the strengths of both communication modes when introducing computer-assisted collaborative learning (CSCL) in a F2F classroom.

22445062;pi285;How can a multimodal approach to primate communication help us understand the evolution of communication?;"Waller B; Liebal K; Burrows A; Slocombe K";Journal Article;Scientists studying the communication of non-human animals are often aiming to better understand the evolution of human communication, including human language. Some scientists take a phylogenetic perspective, where the goal is to trace the evolutionary history of communicative traits, while others take a functional perspective, where the goal is to understand the selection pressures underpinning specific traits. Both perspectives are necessary to fully understand the evolution of communication, but it is important to understand how the two perspectives differ and what they can and cannot tell us. Here, we suggest that integrating phylogenetic and functional questions can be fruitful in better understanding the evolution of communication. We also suggest that adopting a multimodal approach to communication might help to integrate phylogenetic and functional questions, and provide an interesting avenue for research into language evolution.

22444828;pi286;Integrating speech and iconic gestures in a Stroop-like task: Evidence for automatic processing;"Kelly S D; Creigh P; Bartolotti J ";Journal Article;[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 22(12) of Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience (see record [rid]2010-18758-001[/rid]). In the original article Figure 3 was incorrect. Although the caption correctly indicates that the y axis of Figure 3 is negative up, the actual figure shows negative down. The direction of the brainwaves are correct, but the y axis should show negative up. The correct figure is given in the erratum.] Previous research has demonstrated a link between language and action in the brain. The present study investigates the strength of this neural relationship by focusing on a potential interface between the two systems: cospeech iconic gesture. Participants performed a Stroop-like task in which they watched videos of a man and a woman speaking and gesturing about common actions. The videos differed as to whether the gender of the speaker and gesturer was the same or different and whether the content of the speech and gesture was congruent or incongruent. The task was to identify whether a man or a woman produced the spoken portion of the videos while accuracy rates, RTs, and ERPs were recorded to the words. Although not relevant to the task, participants paid attention to the semantic relationship between the speech and the gesture, producing a larger N400 to words accompanied by incongruent versus congruent gestures. In addition, RTs were slower to incongruent versus congruent gesture�speech stimuli, but this effect was greater when the gender of the gesturer and speaker was the same versus different. These results suggest that the integration of gesture and speech during language comprehension is automatic but also under some degree of neurocognitive control.

22445221;pi287;Sensorimotor alpha activity is modulated in response to the observation of pain in others;"Whitmarsh S; Nieuwenhuis I; Barendregt H; Jensen O";Journal Article;The perception�action account of empathy states that observation of another person�s state automatically activates a similar state in the observer. It is still unclear in what way ongoing sensorimotor alpha oscillations are involved in this process. Although they have been repeatedly implicated in (biological) action observation and understanding communicative gestures, less is known about their role in vicarious pain observation. Their role is understood as providing a graded inhibition through functional inhibition, thereby streamlining information flow through the cortex. Although alpha oscillations have been shown to have at least visual and sensorimotor origins, only the latter are expected to be involved in the empathetic response. Here, we used magnetoencephalography, allowing us to spatially distinguish and localize oscillatory components using beam former source reconstruction. Subjects observed realistic pictures of limbs in painful and no-pain (control) conditions. As predicted, time�frequency analysis indeed showed increased alpha suppression in the pain condition compared to the no-pain condition. Although both pain and no-pain conditions suppressed alpha- and beta-band activity at both posterior and central sensors, the pain condition suppressed alpha more only at central sensors. Source reconstruction localized these differences along the central sulcus. Our results could not be accounted for by differences in the evoked fields, suggesting a unique role of oscillatory activity in empathetic responses. We argue that alpha oscillations provide a unique measure of the underlying functional architecture of the brain, suggesting an automatic disinhibition of the sensorimotor cortices in response to the observation of pain in others.

22445668;pi289;The utility of arm and hand gestures in the treatment of aphasia;Rose M L ;Journal Article;People with aphasia frequently rely on communicative 'devices' other than their impaired language system. This article focuses on arm and hand gesture as one such 'device' or modality. Speech-language pathologists face the daily challenge of clinical reasoning choices and management plan decisions for selecting and advising about therapeutic methods and modalities for a wide range of people with aphasia. This article aims to synthesize the relevant information about gesture in aphasia that is otherwise published in a disparate range of sources or with less clinical and more theoretical goals in mind. A description of the types of arm and hand gestures commonly seen in humans and a summary of the debate surrounding their origins and functions is provided as background information. Recent models of gesture production are explored, especially as they relate to the interaction between gesture, speech and language, and to the use of gesture as a therapeutic option in aphasia rehabilitation. The latter also involves understanding the role of limb apraxia in gesture production and gesture-based therapies. Research detailing the gesture abilities of people with aphasia (both receptive and expressive) is reviewed and finally the evidence concerning gesture as a therapeutic agent in aphasia therapy is critiqued.

22445175;pi290;The mirror system, imitation, and the evolution of language;Arbib  M A ;Book Chapter;"This chapter argues that the ability to imitate is a key innovation in the evolutionary path leading to language in the human and relates this hypothesis to specific data on brain mechanisms. In this context, imitation involves more than simply observing someone else's movement and responding with movement that in its entirety is already in one's own repertoire, imitation involves 'parsing' a complex movement. What marks humans as distinct from their common ancestors with chimpanzees is that whereas the chimpanzee can imitate short novel sequences through repeated exposure, humans can acquire (longer) novel sequences in a single trial if the sequences are not too long and the components are relatively familiar. This chapter will take us through seven hypothesized stages of evolution: (1) grasping; (2) a mirror system for grasping; (3) a simple imitation system for grasping; (4) a complex imitation system for grasping; (5) a manual-based communication system; (6) speech, which I here characterize as being the open-ended production and perception of sequences of vocal gestures, without implying that these sequences constitute a language; and (7) language.

Those all sound more like hobbies than scientific pursuits. But such activities are at the heart of recent efforts to understand the emergence and evolution of language. And the trend shows how much the field is changing. Theorizing once dominated work on the origins of language. More recently, researchers have gone into the field to study how songbirds learn to sing and into nurseries to observe the vocalizations and gestures of children for hints of how language may have emerged. The experiments, observations, and even some theorizing were on the agenda at the Evolang 9. That conciliatory tone echoed throughout Evolang 9. People spoke of fitting together the pieces of a very complex puzzle. A new generation of language researchers 'is more interested in an interdisciplinary approach and more tolerant of complexity'. That bodes well for the Evolang conferences, which were founded on the notion that all those studying language evolution should have something to say to one another.

22445321;pi292;Speaking of colors and odors;"Plumacher M; Holz P ";Book Chapter;We are confronted with a huge manifold of diverse sensory impressions which we have to classify and interpret in regard to our former experiences and intentions in acting. We also have to coordinate our sensory impressions with other individuals in order to perform purposeful joint actions and meaningful interactions. Categorization is a cognitive activity that serves both to develop personal experience to an extent that makes quick orientation in new situations possible and to establish inter-individual understanding in processes of joint action. Language is involved in these processes of categorization. What exactly is its specific part? This is the central question of this book. Most of its contributions start from the assumptions that language is complementary to other forms of communication, such as joint attention, regular forms of joint action, gestures and other non-verbal semiotic forms, and that linguistic forms of categorization are based on perceptual discernment and non-linguistic forms of classifying things, events and properties. The articles of this book originate from an international and interdisciplinary conference dealing with the question 'How can language cope with color and smell?'. 'Color' and 'smell' were chosen as subjects to compare the extensively studied field of color perception and color categorization with the less investigated fields of perception and categorization of odors. These comparisons might help to clear controversies, especially as to the prevailing theses that colors can be considered a quasi-continuous spectrum of hues that is completely represented in languages, although in different ways, whereas the manifold of odors cannot be conceived in a systematic arrangement and is not linguistically represented. As the contributions of this book show, this opposition does not grasp the semiotic reality. In many contexts, the linguistic representation of colors refers to colored objects, to practices of color production or to specific experiences of particular colors, just as much as linguistic descriptions of odor refer to objects as sources of odor and to odor experiences. The idea of a systematically arranged spectrum of colors is a relatively late product in the history of ideas. It could also be established that, despite the lack of 'basic terms' of odors, there is linguistic practice of odor description. The fact that many odors are not consciously perceived might be caused both by specific characteristics of the neurophysiological olfactory system and by a less developed cultural need to reflect odors. This fact, however, does not prevent us from analyzing the different strategies to describe olfactory experiences and the forms of categorization that this linguistic representation reveals. Especially studies on linguistic representation of odors indicate the functional role of language within the spectrum of diverse cognitive activities. Language does not express each act of discerning nor does it represent each form of categorization. In some contexts, there are joint activities of discriminating odor experiences between subjects. Unless there is no need to communicate linguistically about a particular type of odor, specific lexemes do not have to be established. Language seems to be involved when non-linguistic activities become subject to reflection. Those contributions to this book which deal with descriptions of odors and colors in advertising focus on a specific power of language, namely its power to compose complex images of multiple sensory experience in connection with ideals of what count as beautiful or desirable.

23080831;pi293;Dynamic, rhythmic facial expressions and the superior temporal sulcus of macaque monkeys: Implications for the evolution of audiovisual speech;"Ghazanfar A; Chandrasekaran C; Morrill R";Journal Article;Audiovisual speech has a stereotypical rhythm that is between 2 and 7 Hz, and deviations from this frequency range in either modality reduce intelligibility. Understanding how audiovisual speech evolved requires investigating the origins of this rhythmic structure. One hypothesis is that the rhythm of speech evolved through the modification of some pre-existing cyclical jaw movements in a primate ancestor. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the temporal structure of lipsmacks and teeth-grinds of macaque monkeys and the neural responses to these facial gestures in the superior temporal sulcus (STS), a region implicated in the processing of audiovisual communication signals in both humans and monkeys. We found that both lipsmacks and teeth-grinds have consistent but distinct peak frequencies and that both fall well within the 2�7 Hz range of mouth movements associated with audiovisual speech. Single neurons and local field potentials of the STS of monkeys readily responded to such facial rhythms, but also responded just as robustly to yawns, a nonrhythmic but dynamic facial expression. All expressions elicited enhanced power in the delta (0�3Hz), theta (3�8Hz), alpha (8�14Hz) and gamma (> 60 Hz) frequency ranges, and suppressed power in the beta (20�40Hz) range. Thus, STS is sensitive to, but not selective for, rhythmic facial gestures. Taken together, these data provide support for the idea that that audiovisual speech evolved (at least in part) from the rhythmic facial gestures of an ancestral primate and that the STS was sensitive to and thus �prepared� for the advent of rhythmic audiovisual communication.

22445700;pi294;Looking for neural answers to linguistic questions;Bichakjian B H ;Book Chapter;Discusses the significance of mirror neurons for the study of language origins and proposes the need for linguistics and neurologists to work together in this endeavor. It is suggested that linguists will have to cast aside their prejudices against evolution, and biologists and advocates of innatist scenarios will need to become better acquainted with the historical record. Issues discussed include head last languages and word order reversal, the shift in writing from right-to-left to left-to-right, and the mirror neurons' action-gesture-articulation scenario. It is suggested that the near congruence of spatial and verbal intelligence areas in the left hemisphere, and the fact that they fall largely outside Broca's area seem to suggest that verbal intelligence and speech articulation are 2 different things, and the rise of the latter does not explain the development of the former.

The teeming neighborhoods of Naples, a Baroque city, have made it into somewhat of a theatrum mundi, producing many fine actors and playwrights. The essay, illustrated by photograms from a few of Tot�'s films, suggests that Neapolitan gesture, whose purpose is communication, is stylized by Tot� and transformed into artistry of a high order.

22445004;pi296;Evolution of the human mind;Corballis M C ;Book Chapter;The hominids split from the apes some 5 million years ago. Evidence from modern African apes suggests that the pre-hominid apes probably possessed limited mind-reading skills and some form of communication through manual gestures. The early hominids were distinguished by bipedal locomotion, which would have imposed greater demands on parents in transporting and caring for their infants, enhancing mind-reading and perspective-taking. Bipedalism would also have freed the arms for a greater range of manual gestures for communication, allowing a sophisticated gestural language to emerge. In the early stages of hominid evolution, vocal communication was probably only a minor accompaniment to gesture, but may have assumed the dominant role with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa some 150,000 to 100,000 years ago. This switch may have been facilitated by the emergence and spread of a genetic allele that ensured that manual and vocal control emanated from the same (left) cerebral hemisphere in the majority of individuals. Vocal language again freed the hands and arms, leading to the development of more sophisticated technologies, allowing this species to radiate from Africa and replace the hominids, including the Neanderthals, who were descended from earlier migrants.

22445461;pi298;On the relation of speech to language;"Liberman A M; Whalen D H ";Journal Article;There are two widely divergent theories about the relation of speech to language. The more conventional view holds that the elements of speech are sounds that rely for their production and perception on two wholly separate processes, neither of which is distinctly linguistic. Accordingly, the primary motor and perceptual representations are inappropriate for linguistic purposes until a cognitive process of some sort has connected them to language and to each other. The less conventional theory takes the speech elements to be articulatory gestures that are the primary objects of both production and perception. Those gestures form a natural class that serves a linguistic function and no other. Therefore, their representations are immediately linguistic, requiring no cognitive intervention to make them appropriate for use by the other components of the language system. The unconventional view provides the more plausible answers to three important questions: (1) How was the necessary parity between speaker and listener established in evolution, and how maintained? (2) How does speech meet the special requirements that underlie its ability, unique among natural communication systems, to encode an indefinitely large number of meanings? (3) What biological properties of speech make it easier than the reading and writing of its alphabetic transcription?

23080827;pi299;Dingoes (Canis dingo) can use human social cues to locate hidden food;"Smith B; Litchfield C";Journal Article;There is contention concerning the role that domestication plays in the responsiveness of canids to human social cues, with most studies investigating abilities of recognized domestic dog breeds or wolves. Valuable insight regarding the evolution of social communication with humans might be gained by investigating Australian dingoes, which have an early history of domestication, but have been free-ranging in Australia for approximately 3500�5000 years. Seven �pure� dingoes were tested outdoors by a familiar experimenter using the object-choice paradigm to determine whether they could follow nine human communicative gestures previously tested with domestic dogs and captive wolves. Dingoes passed all cues significantly above control, including the 'benchmark' momentary distal pointing, with the exception of gaze only, gaze and point, and pointing from the incorrect location. Dingo performance appears to lie somewhere between wolves and dogs, which suggests that domestication may have played a role in their ability to comprehend human gestures.

22445399;pi301;Hand-clapping as a communicative gesture by wild female swamp gorillas;"Kalan A; Rainey H ";Journal Article;Hand-clapping is a form of gestural communication commonly observed in captive great apes yet only isolated instances of this behavior have been documented in the wild. Nearly 20 years ago Fay recorded the first observations of hand-clapping in western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in the Central African Republic. Here we present observations of Likouala swamp gorillas using hand-clapping as a form of gestural communication in previously undocumented contexts in the wild. We observed hand-clapping on four different occasions in four different groups. The hand-clap was always exhibited by an adult female and always consisted of two consecutive claps conducted in front of the body. We suggest the functional significance of the behavior was to maintain and enforce group cohesiveness during instances of alarm. These observations suggest western lowland gorillas have a means of communicating that is thus far absent in their eastern counterparts (Gorilla beringei ssp.). This could be a gestural culture found only in western lowland gorillas which should be investigated further to shed light on the evolution of communication among hominoids.

22445234;pi302;The role of gesture and mimetic representation in making language the province of speech;"Goldin-Meadow S; McNeill D";Book Chapter;"Proposes that the oral modality of language assumed the segmented and combinatorial code not because of its strengths but to compensate for its weaknesses. The oral modality is not well suited to conveying messages mimetically. The manual modality consequently assumes the role of mimetic encoding, in the form of spontaneous gestures found to accompany speech in all cultures (P. Feyereisen and J.-D. de Lannoy, 1991; D. McNeill, 1992). This argument rests on several assumptions. First that the manual modality is as adept as the oral modality at segmented and combinatorial encoding. The authors describe data supporting this assumption in a review of the structural properties of signed languages, both conventional and idiosyncratic. The second assumption is that mimetic encoding is an important aspect of human communication, well served by the manual modality. Data supporting this assumption in a review of the gestures that are spontaneously produced along with speech are presented. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the advantages of having a language system that contains both a mimetic and segmented/combinatorial code (M. Donald; see record [rid]1999-04113-008[/rid]), and of the role that gesture might have played in linguistic evolution.

23080855;pi303;Modeling the production of coverbal iconic gestures by learning Bayesian decision networks;"Bergmann K; Kopp S";Journal Article;Expressing spatial information with iconic gestures is abundant in human communication and requires transforming information about a referent into resembling gestural form. This transformation is barely understood and hard to model for expressive virtual agents because it is influenced by the visuospatial features of the referent and the overall discourse context or concomitant speech and its outcome varies considerably across different speakers. We use Bayesian decision networks (BDN) to achieve such a model. Different machine learning techniques are applied to a data corpus of speech and gesture use in a spatial domain to investigate how to learn such networks. Modeling results from an implemented generation system are presented and evaluated against the original corpus data to find out how BDNs can be applied to human gesture formation and which structure learning algorithm performs best.

Present in communication, the body incarnates the possibility of understanding gestures and words, stressing the bodily character of significance, the apprehension of which lies in the reciprocity of behaviors experienced in the social dimension. We also develop the concept of spoken language; according to Merleau-Ponty, the sense of language was expropriated of the word by the empiricist and idealist conceptions, based in Cartesianism. Merleau-Ponty observes an immanence of the sense in the word, pointing that the understanding of the language refers to the analysis of the original expressive gesture. The founder character of language is shown in the ambiguous relationships between speech and thinking, meaning and word, significance and significant. This ambiguity, present in all forms of language constitutes the very nature of the expression.

22445045;pi305;Lashley's problem of serial order and the evolution of learnable vocal and manual communication;MacNeilage P F ;Book Chapter;Two main taxonomic groups are most expert in learning their specialized communication systems-humans and songbirds. In both cases the upshot of this learning is sets of complex time-extended, serially organized signal strings. Humans have two such forms of communication, using two different signaling modalities. They have speech, and its gestural-visual equivalent, sign language. Birdsong, like speech uses the vocalauditory modality. Thus, what one could call the problem space for learnable communication at the transmission level has two main variables, a taxonomically-based language/non language dichotomy having to do with the nature of the information transmitted, and a modality dichotomy in language-vocal/auditory versus gestural/visual. In this paper, author wants to argue for a conclusion which is quite radical in the context of the anthropocentric perspective from which the question of learnable communication is usually viewed. The author suggests that modality is more important than informational content in the understanding of the serial organization of these three learnable behaviors. The argument is based on the conclusion that, in terms of its organization in the time domain, speech is more like birdsong than it is like sign language.

22445119;pi306;Individual differences in social, cognitive, and morphological aspects of infant pointing;"Liszkowski U; Tomasello M";Journal Article;Little is known about the origins of the pointing gesture. We sought to gain insight into its emergence by investigating individual differences in the pointing of 12-month-old infants in two ways. First, we looked at differences in the communicative and interactional uses of pointing and asked how different hand shapes relate to point frequency, accompanying vocalizations, and mothers� pointing. Second, we looked at differences in social-cognitive skills of point comprehension and imitation and tested whether these were related to infants� own pointing. Infants� and mothers� spontaneous pointing correlated with one another, as did infants� point production and comprehension. In particular, infants� index-finger pointing had a profile different from simple whole-hand pointing. It was more frequent, it was more often accompanied by vocalizations, and it correlated more strongly with comprehension of pointing (especially to occluded referents). We conclude that whole-hand and index-finger pointing differ qualitatively and suggest that it is index-finger pointing that first embodies infants� understanding of communicative intentions.

22445035;pi307;Coverbal behavior and aphasic speakers;"Katz R C; LaPointe L L; Markel N N";Journal Article;By now most aphasiologists are aware of the ways individuals communicate during face to- face conversation. By defining the origins and destinations of these interdependent communicative behaviors, we can isolate their different channels. Some current aphasia research has emphasized the study of nonverbal behavior to increase our understanding of the role gestures play with respect to verbal language and language recovery. This body of knowledge led to development of the treatment programs for both verbal stimulation and for compensatory word-retrieval strategies. These nonverbal communicative behaviors are collectively called coverbal behavior, and we define them as the behaviors of interlocutors which occur in association with or accompanying words, but which are not essential for the articulatory or grammatical functioning of those words. The results of this study indicate that, for the mildly and moderately impaired aphasic speaker, coverbal behavior is unimpaired and can function as a means of communication during speech and during unsuccessful speech attempts. Indeed, aphasic speakers are better communicators than they are language users.

22444816;pi308;Intentional and attentional dynamics of speech-hand coordination;"Treffner P; Peter M";Journal Article;Interest is rapidly growing in the hypothesis that natural language emerged from a more primitive set of linguistic acts based primarily on manual activity and hand gestures. Increasingly, researchers are investigating how hemispheric asymmetries are related to attentional and manual asymmetries. Both speech perception and production have origins in the dynamical generative movements of the vocal tract known as articulatory gestures. Thus, the notion of a 'gesture' can be extended to both hand movements and speech articulation. The generative actions of the hands and vocal tract can therefore provide a basis for the perception of linguistic acts. Such gestures are best described using the methods of dynamical systems analysis since both perception and production can be described using the same commensurate language. Experiments were conducted using a phase transition paradigm to examine the coordination of speech-hand gestures in both left- and right-handed individuals. Results address coordination, hand, lateralization, focus of attention, and how dynamical constraints provide a foundation for human communicative acts. Predictions from the asymmetric HKB equation confirm the attentional basis of functional asymmetry.

The present article makes a comprehensive review on the most important processes underlying the mechanisms of infant language acquisition in the first year of life followed by a discussion on their relation to child psychopathology. Some research findings in this area have brought support to the hypothesis of a continuity instead of a discontinuity, that seems to exist from the infant initial communicative signals, such as gesture, facial expression and preverbal vocalizations, to the best known milestones of the child language development. The particular aspects concerning the origin of a symbolic code - the origin of language - are introduced to the reader.

23080858;pi311;Monkey drumming reveals common networks for perceiving vocal and nonvocal communication sounds;"Remedios R; Logothetis N; Kayser C";Journal Article;Salient sounds such as those created by drumming can serve as means of nonvocal acoustic communication in addition to vocal sounds. Despite the ubiquity of drumming across human cultures, its origins and the brain regions specialized in processing such signals remain unexplored. Here, we report that an important animal model for vocal communication, the macaque monkey, also displays drumming behavior, and we exploit this finding to show that vocal and nonvocal communication sounds are represented by overlapping networks in the brain's temporal lobe. Observing social macaque groups, we found that these animals use artificial objects to produce salient periodic sounds, similar to acoustic gestures. Behavioral tests confirmed that these drumming sounds attract the attention of listening monkeys similarly as conspecific vocalizations. Furthermore, in a preferential looking experiment, drumming sounds influenced the way monkeys viewed their conspecifics, suggesting that drumming serves as a multimodal signal of social dominance. Finally, by using high-resolution functional imaging we identified those brain regions preferentially activated by drumming sounds or by vocalizations and found that the representations of both these communication sounds overlap in caudal auditory cortex and the amygdala. The similar behavioral responses to drumming and vocal sounds, and their shared neural representation, suggest a common origin of primate vocal and nonvocal communication systems and support the notion of a gestural origin of speech and music.

23080856;pi312;A method for transcribing the manual components of Cued Speech;"Krause J C; Pelley-Lopez K A; Tessler M P";Journal Article;Designed to allow visual communication of speech signals, Cued Speech consists of discrete hand signals that are produced in synchrony with the visual mouth movements of speech. The purpose of this paper is to describe a method for transcribing these hand signals. Procedures are presented for identifying (1) the steady-state portion of the cue to be analyzed, (2) the cue's handshape, and (3) the cue�s placement. Reliability is evaluated, using materials from 12 cuers that were transcribed on two separate occasions (either by the original rater or a second rater). Results show very good intra-rater and inter-rater reliability on average, which remained good across a variety of individual cuers, even when the cuer's hand gestures were heavily coarticulated. Given its high reliability, this transcription method may be of benefit to applications that require systematic and quantitative analysis of Cued Speech production in various populations. In addition, some of the transcription principles from this method may be helpful in improving accuracy of automatic Cued Speech recognition systems.

Several models have demonstrated the emergence of structure in a symbolic medium, but none has demonstrated the emergence of the capacity for symbolic representation. The current shift in cognitive science toward theoretical frameworks based on embodiment is already furnishing computational models with additional mechanisms relevant to the emergence of symbolic language. An analysis of embodied interaction among captive, but not human-enculturated, bonobo chimpanzees reveals a number of additional features of embodiment that are relevant to the emergence of symbolic language, but that have not yet been explored in computational simulation models; for example, complementarity of action in addition to imitation, iconic in addition to indexical gesture, coordination among multiple sensory and perceptual modalities, and the orchestration of intra- and inter-individual motor coordination. The bonobos provide an evolutionarily plausible intermediate stage in the development of symbolic expression that can inform efforts to model the emergence of symbolic language.

L. L. Namy and S. R. Waxman previously reported that children aged 1;6 interpreted novel arbitrary words and manual gestures as names for object categories but that at 2;2, children interpreted words as names more readily than gestures. Based on this finding and other observational evidence of gesture use, it has been suggested that the younger infants have an initial general symbolic capacity that encompasses both words and gestures. Over time, as infants acquire greater experience with language, words begin to take on a greater priority in the infant's communicative repertoire. The current study examines this hypothesis by analyzing 64 children's spontaneous production of the novel symbols in Namy and Waxman's original task. At 1;6, children rarely produced either the novel words or gestures. At 2;2, children frequently produced both symbolic forms; however, words were produced in a referential manner while gestures were produced in a non-referential manner. These findings are consistent with the argument that over time, words supplant gestures as a symbolic medium.

In the debate over continuities vs discontinuities in the emergence of language, sign language is not taken to be the antithesis but is presented as the antecedent of spoken languages. Several recent elucidations of face-to-face behavior microscopically observed show the importance of expression by gestural signs (gSigns) of the infant's developing communicative needs. They also show smooth transition of the communcational synchrony achieved by very young infants in their performance of communicative actions (and in some instances of reflexive body movements) into the kind of behavior to be discerned in adult language competence. The ease of learning conferred by iconic gSigns leads to early lexico-semantic mastery when speech is not the major channel. Various parts of the grammar of American Sign Language, particularly its verb and pronoun systems, give convincing evidence that such grammar cannot have derived from the grammars of spoken languages; rather, that the continuity is from cognitive activity expressed in gSigns toward linguistic organization both of the expressive material and the semantic, and thence into spoken language.

Embracing the power of beauty has always been problematic for feminism, and for good reason. We have yet to create a language for our own yearning or find an expression for our own radiance that could embrace other women rather than attempt to outshine them. We have yet to realize that our expression of beauty itself has an evolution that continually expands our identity and embodiment over the course of development. This chapter therefore offers an All-Quadrants, All-Levels (AQAL) analysis of some of the current views that dominate feminist discourse on women's beauty. It is also a personal story of my own ongoing journey as a young woman trying to reclaim my beauty, for the benefit of all beings.

22445361;pi318;Comparative perspectives on pointing and joint attention in children and apes;Krause M A ;Journal Article;The comprehension and production of manual pointing and joint visual attention are already well developed when human infants reach their 2nd year. These early developmental milestones mark the infant's transition into accelerated linguistic competence and shared experiences with others. The ability to draw another's attention toward distal objects or events facilitates the development of complex cognitive processes such as language acquisition. A comparative approach allowed the authors to examine the evolution of these phenomena. Of recent interest is whether non-human primates also gesture and manipulate the eye gaze direction of others when communicating. However, all captive apes do not use referential gestures such as pointing, or appear to understand the meaning of shared attention. Those that show evidence of these abilities differ in their expression of them, and this may be closely related to rearing history. This paper reviews the literature on the topic of pointing and joint attention in non-human primates with the goal of identifying why these abilities develop in other species, and to examine the potential sources of the existing individual variation in their expression.

All of these signs have negative connotations. We identify the etymon of the signs as an emblematic gesture of hostility used by hearing people since the 15th century. Inherited from the hearing milieu, the gesture evolved into an important lexical family in use by the deaf in both LSF and its sister language, American Sign Language (ASL). At each step in the gestures evolution, two conceptual mechanisms explain changes in both form and meaning: economy of articulation and metaphorical abstraction. We show that latent meanings have been invested in the signs' handshapes, placements, and movements, all of which were inherited from gestures of the hearing world.

This technique allows for the examination of parts of the vocal tract otherwise inaccessible to dynamic imaging or movement tracking. The present experiment considers syllable onset, coda, and juncture geminate nasals and also addresses the effects of a variety of word stress patterns on segment internal coordination. We find a bimodal timing pattern in which near-synchrony of velum lowering and tongue tip raising characterizes the timing for onsets and temporal lag between the gestures is characteristic for codas, supporting and extending the findings for [m] of Krakow [(1989).

We examined the recognition of nonverbal emotional vocalizations, such as screams and laughs, across two dramatically different cultural groups. Western participants were compared to individuals from remote, culturally isolated Namibian villages. Vocalizations communicating the so-called “basic emotions” (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise) were bidirectionally recognized. In contrast, a set of additional emotions was only recognized within, but not across, cultural boundaries.

22445500;pi324;Adapting to the human world: Dogs' responsiveness to our social cues;Reid Pamela J ;Journal Article;Dogs are more skilful than a host of other species at tasks which require they respond to human communicative gestures in order to locate hidden food. Four basic interpretations for this proficiency surface from distilling the research findings. One possibility is that dogs simply have more opportunity than other species to learn to be responsive to human social cues. A different analysis suggests that the domestication process provided an opening for dogs to apply general cognitive problem-solving skills to a novel social niche. Some researchers go beyond this account and propose that dogs� co-evolution with humans equipped them with a theory of mind for social exchanges. Finally, a more prudent approach suggests that sensitivity to the behaviours of both humans and conspecifics would be particularly advantageous for a social scavenger like the dog. A predisposition to attend to human actions allows for rapid early learning of the association between gestures and the availability of food.

We analyzed asymmetries in ratios of white to grey matter in the lateral aspect of the lobes of the brains of chimpanzees. We found marked leftward asymmetries for all lobar regions. This asymmetry was particularly pronounced in the frontal region and was found to be related to handedness for communicative manual gestures as well as for tool use. These results point to a continuity in asymmetry patterns between the human and chimpanzee brain, and support the notion that the anatomical substrates for lateralization of communicative functions and complex manipulative activities may have been present in the common hominid ancestor.

Most studies suggest that the language lateralization is related to a fundamental brain asymmetry: right-handedness may be secondary. We analyzed the possibility of an opposite cause/effect relation: whether asymmetric hand usage (as a cause) can influence language lateralization (as a consequence). Methods: We determined language lateralization by functional magnetic resonance imaging in 15 subjects whose upper limb (UL) had been injured at birth because of unilateral damage of the brachial plexus. These subjects were able to use only one (the noninjured) UL perfectly. Results: We found correlation between the severity of right-sided UL injuries and hand usage dysfunction and the degree of left-to-right shift of language lateralization. There was, however, not a complete switch of language lateralization. Interpretation: Right-sided UL injury can induce a left-to-right shift in language lateralization, suggesting that hand usage can influence language lateralization. These findings may contradict the broadly accepted theory that right-handedness is a secondary phenomenon caused by left-sided hemispheric language lateralization. However, the cause/effect problem between asymmetric hand usage and language lateralization is not resolved in this study. Our findings may support the theory that gestures had a crucial role in human language evolution and is a part of the language system even today.

22445081;pi328;The Evolution of Human Speech: Its Anatomical and Neural Bases;Lieberman P;Journal Article;"Human speech involves species-specific anatomy deriving from the descent of the tongue into the pharynx. The human tongue's shape and position yields the 1:1 oral-to-pharyngeal proportions of the supralaryngeal vocal tract. Speech also requires a brain that can 'reiterate'--freely reorder a finite set of motor gestures to form a potentially infinite number of words and sentences. The end points of the evolutionary process are clear. The chimpanzee lacks a supralaryngeal vocal tract capable of producing the 'quantal' sounds which facilitate both speech production and perception and a brain that can reiterate the phonetic contrasts apparent in its fixed vocalizations. The traditional Broca-Wernicke brain-language theory is incorrect; neural circuits linking regions of the cortex with the basal ganglia and other subcortical structures regulate motor control, including speech production, as well as cognitive processes including syntax. The dating of the FOXP2 gene, which governs the embryonic development of these subcortical structures, provides an insight on the evolution of speech and language. The starting points for human speech and language were perhaps walking and running.

22445609;pi329;A comparative analysis of animals' understanding of the human pointing gesture;"Miklósi Á; Soproni K";Journal Article;We review studies demonstrating the ability of some animals to understand the human pointing gesture. We present a 3-step analysis of the topic. (1) We compare and evaluate current experimental methods (2) We compare available experimental results on performance of different species and investigate the interaction of species differences and other independent variables (3) We evaluate how our present understanding of pointing comprehension answers questions about function, evolution and mechanisms. Recently, a number of different hypotheses have been put forward to account for the presence of this ability in some species and for the lack of such comprehension in others. In our view, there is no convincing evidence for the assumption that the competitive lifestyles of apes would inhibit the utilization of this human gesture. Similarly, domestication as a special evolutionary factor in the case of some species falls short in explaining high levels of pointing comprehension in some non-domestic species. We also disagree with the simplistic view of describing the phenomenon as a simple form of conditioning. We suggest that a more systematic comparative research is needed to understand the emerging communicative representational abilities in animals that provide the background for comprehending the human pointing gesture.

22445210;pi330;Gesture and sign;Marschark M;Journal Article;Explores the distinction between gestures and sign language and considers the functional role of gestures that are embedded within sign language productions of deaf individuals. Of particular interest is the issue of whether the gestures used by deaf adults and children are qualitatively different in origin, form, frequency, or function from the gestures used by hearing individuals. Gesture and sign are considered with an eye toward determining those aspects of manual communication that are specific to users of signed languages and those in common with users of oral languages. This examination reveals that gestures produced by deaf individuals can be distinguished from the sign language in which they are embedded, both in terms of their privilege of occurrence and their semantic and pragmatic functions.

22444849;pi332;Aphasia, apraxia and the evolution of the language-ready brain;Arbib M A;Journal Article;Background: The Mirror System Hypothesis offers the mirror system for grasping (i.e., neural mechanisms active for both execution and observation of grasping) as a neural 'missing link' between the brains of our non-human ancestors of 20 million years ago and the modern human language-ready brain, stressing the importance of manual gesture in the evolution of mechanisms supporting language. Aims: To assess the view that neural mechanisms for both praxis and language share an evolutionary relationship to the ancestral mirror system for grasping. Main Contribution: The praxis system receives a new analysis based on the attempt to link human praxis to computational models of execution and observation of grasping in the macaque as well as the analysis of parallels between language and praxis. Conclusions: The conceptual analysis presented here may prove insightful for clinicians seeking to relate and differentiate aphasia and apraxia.

22445020;pi333;On the origins of modern gesture studies;Kendon A;Book Chapter;Interest in gesture in the Western tradition dates from the late Roman era. Scholarly studies first appear at the very end of the sixteenth century. Gesture drew philosophical interest in the eighteenth century when speculations on the natural origins of human language began. Although in the nineteenth century, especially with the emergence of anthropology, interest in gesture remained high, by the beginning of the twentieth century it appears to have declined sharply and there was a veritable dearth of studies until the 1970s. From this time forward, as speculation on language origins again returned to favour, with the growth of interest in sign languages and with a revival of interest in the cognitive foundations of language, the study of gesture resumed. Especially important has been the demonstration by David McNeill, among others, that gesture serves to express aspects of the conceptual content of utterances and is not just affective decoration.

22444839;pi335;The gestural communication of apes;"Pika S; Liebal K; Call J; Tomasello M";Journal Article;Gestural communication of nonhuman primates may allow insight into the evolutionary scenario of human communication given the flexible use and learning of gestures as opposed to vocalizations. This paper provides an overview of the work on the gestural communication of apes with the focus on their repertoire, learning mechanisms, and the flexibility of gesture use during interactions with conspecifics. Although there is a variation between the species in the types and numbers of gestures performed, the influence of ecology, social structure and cognitive skills on their gestural repertoires is relatively restricted. As opposed to humans, apes do not use their gestures referentially nor do their gestures show the symbolic or conventionalized features of human gestural communication. However, since the gestural repertoires of apes are characterized by a high degree of individual variability and flexibility of use as opposed to their vocalizations it seems plausible that the gestures were the modality within which symbolic communication first evolved.

22445091;pi336;Do captive mandrills invent new gestures?;Laidre M E ;Journal Article;"[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 13(1) of Animal Cognition (see record [rid]2009-24962-017[/rid]). The author kindly thanks Jessica Yorzinski for providing the photo used for Fig. 1a in the original article.] Studies of intraspecic behavioral variability have documented cases where behaviors are present in some populations or groups but are absent in others. In some cases these differences cannot be explained by recourse to environmental or genetic variation, and may instead represent 'traditions'. Despite many examples of animal traditions in acoustic communication, relatively few examples exist of gestural traditions. Here I report on a study of communication across eight captive groups of mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) in which a prominent gesture (Hand extension) was unique to two groups. Habitat variability, genetic differences, and sampling bias were not sufficient to account for the gesture's limited distribution across the study groups. Within the two groups where the gesture did occur only the juveniles in the group performed it, consistently directing it toward adults. Quantitative analysis of the contexts and responses associated with the gesture suggested that juveniles utilized it to provoke adults. Moreover, the gesture appeared to minimize the risk juveniles incurred while inciting adults, suggesting that repeated social interactions shaped the gesture's form. Interestingly, both the groups where the gesture emerged contained few juveniles. With limited play partners, these juveniles may have resorted to harassing adults as an alternative social play outlet. The creation of this novel gesture may thus be due to the combined influence of a shortage of play partners and of the increased free time for playful social exploration afforded by captivity. Although juveniles frequently 'eavesdropped' on dyadic interactions involving the gesture and would subsequently initiate an interaction with the recipient of the gesture, there was no definitive evidence for social transmission; the gesture could instead have been independently invented by each juvenile.

Moreover, they are the basis for the flexibility and plasticity observed in the early development of humans and apes.

22445722;pi339;Human-like social skills in dogs?;"Hare B; Tomasello M";Journal Article;Domestic dogs are unusually skilled at reading human social and communicative behavior - even more so than our nearest primate relatives. For example, they use human social and communicative behavior (e.g. a pointing gesture) to find hidden food, and they know what the human can and cannot see in various situations. Recent comparisons between canid species suggest that these unusual social skills have a heritable component and initially evolved during domestication as a result of selection on systems mediating fear and aggression towards humans. Differences in chimpanzee and human temperament suggest that a similar process may have been an important catalyst leading to the evolution of unusual social skills in our own species. The study of convergent evolution provides an exciting opportunity to gain further insights into the evolutionary processes leading to human-like forms of cooperation and communication.

22445449;pi340;Stimulating language: Insights from TMS;"Devlin J T; Watkins K E";Journal Article;"Fifteen years ago, Pascual-Leone and colleagues used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate speech production in pre-surgical epilepsy patients and in doing so, introduced a novel tool into language research. TMS can be used to non-invasively stimulate a specific cortical region and transiently disrupt information processing. These 'virtual lesion' studies offer not only the ability to explore causal relations between brain regions and language functions absent in functional neuroimaging, but also spatial and temporal precision not typically available in patient studies. For instance, TMS has been used to demonstrate functionally distinct sub-regions of the left inferior frontal gyrus; to clarify the relationship between pre-morbid language organization and susceptibility to unilateral lesions and to investigate the contribution of both left and right hemisphere language areas in recovery from aphasia. When TMS is used as a measure of functional connectivity, it demonstrates a close link between action words and motor programmes; it suggests a potential evolutionary link between hand gestures and language and it suggests a role in speech perception for the motor system underlying speech production. In combination with functional neuroimaging, it can elucidate the circuits responsible for this involvement. Finally, TMS may even be useful for enhancing recovery in aphasic patients. In other words, TMS has already become an important tool for studying language at both the cognitive and neural levels, and it is clear that further developments in TMS methodology are likely to result in even greater opportunities for language research.

22444977;pi341;Fostering learner autonomy: Power and reciprocity in the relationship between language learner and language learning adviser;Ciekanski M;Journal Article;Developments in lifelong learning and learner autonomy have given fresh impetus to the debate about learning without formal teaching. This paper concerns the educational relationship between learner and adviser in self-directed schemes. Two French self-directed language learning set-ups were observed, one situated at university level (Syst�me d'apprentissage autodirig� avec soutien, Universit� Nancy 2), the second in a lifelong learning institution (Apprentissage en semi-autonomie, CNAM, Paris), and both dealing with adult language learners. Observations of 31 advising sessions between four learners and four experienced advisers suggest that the latter assume multiple modified pedagogical roles when assisting learners and that they switch between these roles frequently with the same learner. To understand the nature and the purpose of these variations in advising, the study focuses on the linguistic and educational aspects which characterize the advising sessions. Interviews with the advisers and learners were also carried out. These were designed to analyze the nature of advising practices viewed as professional practice. Their analysis highlights the determinants of the advisers' educational strategies, the perception of advising standards and the maintenance and evolution of their 'professional gestures'. The concept of educational reciprocity provides a useful framework for an understanding of the specific pedagogical relationship of language advising sessions.

23080800;pi342;Task-dependent modulation of functional connectivity between hand motor cortices and neuronal networks underlying language and music: A transcranial magnetic stimulation study in humans;"Sparing R; Meister I G; Wienemann M; Buelte D; Staedtgen M; Boroojerdi B";Journal Article;Although language functions are, in general, attributed to the left hemisphere, it is still a matter of debate to what extent the cognitive functions underlying the processing of music are lateralized in the human brain. To investigate hemispheric specialization we evaluated the effect of different overt musical and linguistic tasks on the excitability of both left and right hand motor cortices using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Task-dependent changes of the size of the TMS-elicited motor evoked potentials were recorded in 12 right-handed, musically naive subjects during and after overt speech, singing and humming, i.e. the production of melody without word articulation. The articulation of meaningless syllables served as control condition. We found reciprocal lateralized effects of overt speech and musical tasks on motor cortex excitability. During overt speech, the corticospinal projection of the left (i.e. dominant) hemisphere to the right hand was facilitated. In contrast, excitability of the right motor cortex increased during both overt singing and humming, whereas no effect was observed on the left hemisphere. Although the traditional concept of hemispheric lateralization of music has been challenged by recent neuroimaging studies, our findings demonstrate that right-hemisphere preponderance of music is nevertheless present. We discuss our results in terms of the recent concepts on evolution of language and gesture, which hypothesize that cerebral networks mediating hand movement and those subserving language processing are functionally linked. TMS may constitute a useful tool to further investigate the relationship between cortical representations of motor functions, music and language using comparative approaches.

Based on evidence from apes learning an interspecies visual communication system and children acquiring a first language, we conclude that the potential to combine two different kinds of semiotic element--deictic and representational--was fundamental to the protolanguage forming the foundation for the earliest human language. This is a form of compositionality, in that each communicative element stands for a single semantic element. The conclusion that human protolanguage was exclusively holophrastic--containing a proposition in a single word--emerges only if one considers the symbol alone, without taking into account the gesture as a second element comprising the total message.

22445233;pi346;Evolution of the generative mind;Corballis M C;Book Chapter;In evolution, the increase in brain size and the prolongation of postnatal brain growth that was necessary for this development may have taken place over the past 2 million years. Hominid evolution can be divided into three broad phases. The early hominid phase was dedicated largely to the development of protolanguage and an expansion of representations based on bodily gestures, brought about by bipedalism and the freeing of the hands and arms for locomotion. The later, hunter�gatherer phase may have seen the emergence of more generative modes of thought and language, made possible by alterations to the pattern of growth, so that much of the growth of an enlarged brain took place after birth in order to receive progressive imprints from experience. The final, modern phase may have seen the eventual replacement of bodily gestures and forms of representations by a speech code, which freed the hands, and the imagination, for a wider range of generative action.

The aim was to highlight specificities that would be useful for early diagnosis and care. Home videos of eight boys with autism compared with eight normal boys, 1 to 3 years old, were analyzed using a newly devised model of gestures. Each film was divided into four periods of six months. The results showed that the three expressive modes coincided differently according to the relevant categories and periods. Although the influence of language and development delay were not controlled, these preliminary findings showed that gestures, combined or not with gaze and oralization, are indicators for an early detection of autism.

We report a series of 10 studies on the social-cognitive abilities of three young chimpanzees. The studies were all ones previously conducted with human infants. The chimpanzees were 1-5 years of age, had been raised mostly by humans, and were tested mostly directly by a familiar human experimenter. First, in a longitudinal investigation with repeated measurements from a social-cognitive test battery, the three young chimpanzees were similar in many ways to human infants; the major difference was a total lack of attempts to share attention with others either in joint attentional interactions or through declarative gestures. Second, in imitation-based tests of the understanding of intentional action, the chimpanzees, like human infants, showed an understanding of failed attempts and accidents; but they did not pay attention to the behavioral style of the actor or the actor's reasons for choosing a particular behavioral means. Third, in tests of their understanding of visual perception, the chimpanzees followed the gaze direction of a human to an out-of-sight location behind a barrier and gestured more to a human who could see them than to one who could not; but they showed no understanding that perceivers can focus their attention on one thing, or one aspect of a thing, within their perceptual fields for a reason. Finally, in tests of joint intentions and joint attention, the chimpanzees showed no ability to either reverse roles with a partner in a collaborative interaction or to set up a joint attentional framework for understanding the communicative intentions behind a pointing gesture. Taken together, these findings support the idea that the early ontogeny of human social cognition comprises two distinct trajectories, each with its own evolutionary history: one for understanding the basics of goal-directed action and perception, common to all apes, and another for sharing psychological states with others in collaborative acts-involving joint intentions and attention, unique to the human species.

22445486;pi352;Musical communication: The body movements of performance;"Davidson J; Malloch S";Book Chapter;"The role of body movement in creating and communicating music, and in conveying extra-musical meaning during performance, has attracted academic attention. Beyond the obvious need for a body to interact with a musical instrument in order to create musical sounds, the idea has been explored that musical meaning itself originates in the body, that music is experienced as movement (for example, Cox 2001, 2006; Davidson and Correia 2002; Malloch 2005; Cross and Morley, Chapter 5, Lee and Sch�gler, Chapter 6, and Panskepp and Trevarthen, Chapter 7, this volume). Many of these ideas have been inspired by the writing of philosophers Mark Johnson and George Lakoff (Johnson 1987; Johnson and Larson 2003; Lakoff and Johnson 1980, 1999) who argue that the body reveals and shapes all mental states, both conscious and unconscious. We have been excited by these proposals, and have independently researched the role of the body in the creation of expressive musical communication. The second author has investigated the very earliest mother-infant interactions, arguing that caregiver-infant communication is an expression of our intrinsic musicality (Malloch 1999; Trevarthen and Malloch 2000). The first author has been developing the idea that our vocal communication, most typically experienced between adults as speech and filtered through complex social and cultural practices, is a process parallel to our development and production of musical expression. Thus, musical performance might be conceived of as the performer communicating with co-performers and audience through the intrinsic musicality of body movements, the sounds that are produced by the movements of the body being disciplined by cultural practice and performance technique so as to create meaning in a gestural narrative. In this chapter we explore these ideas, and show how our independent research efforts come together to bring practical insights to important theoretical questions around how musical communication takes place. We briefly explore two types of performance as illustrations. First, we consider the performances of Amy Wu, a Cantonese singer, to demonstrate that Amy's vocal sounds and bodily movements co-specify a number of interlocking messages: an interpretation of the song being performed, sociocultural rules relating to performance etiquette, a projected sense of the performer's social self, and an intimate sense of the self revealed by the performer. In other words, the performance is a complex communication within the medium of music, emerging out of a range of communicative principles, including self-awareness. Second, we explore the musical sounds and overall movement patterns of two professional Western classical performers�a flautist and a clarinettist. The emphasis is on how the overall movement patterns change as a function of familiarity with the piece, as well as with the change from playing solo to playing in duet. In particular, we show how the movements permit co-specification of musical expression with co-regulation of movement in time.

Since Lieberman & Crelin postulated in 1971 the theory that 'Neanderthal man did not have the anatomical prerequisites for producing the full range of human speech' their speech capability has been a subject of hot debate for over 30 years, and remains a controversial question. In this study, we first question the methodology adopted by Lieberman and Crelin, and we point out articulatory and acoustic flaws in the data and the modeling. Then we propose a general articulatory-acoustic framework for testing the acoustic consequences of the trade-off between oral and pharyngeal cavities. Specifically, following Honda & Tiede (1998), we characterize this trade-off by a Laryngeal Height Index (LHI) corresponding to the length ratio of the pharyngeal cavity to the oral cavity. Using an anthropomorphic articulatory model controlled by lips, jaw, tongue and larynx parameters, we can generate the Maximal Vowel Space (MVS), which is a triangle in the Fl / F2 plane, the three point vowels /a/,/i/, and /u/ being located at its three extremities. We sample the evolution of the position of the larynx from birth to adulthood with four different LHI values, and we show that the associated MVS are very similar. Therefore, the MVS of a given vocal tract does not depend on the LHI: gestures of the tongue body, lips and jaw allow compensations for differences in the ratio between the dimensions of the oral cavity and pharynx. We then infer that the vowel space of Neandertals (with high or low larynx) was potentially no smaller than that of a modern human and that Neandertals could produce all the vowels of the world's languages. Neandertals were no more vocally handicapped than children at birth are. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the lowering of the larynx and a concomitant increase in pharynx size are necessary evolutionary pre-adaptations for speech. However, since our study is strictly limited to the morphological and acoustic aspects of the vocal tract, we cannot offer any definitive answer to the question of whether Neandertals could produce human speech or not.

22444951;pi354;To move or not to move: How apes adjust to the attentional state of others;"Liebal K; Pika S; Call J; Tomasello M";Journal Article;A previous observational study suggested that when faced with a partner with its back turned, chimpanzees tend to move around to the front of a non-attending partner and then gesture--rather than gesturing once to attract attention and then again to convey a specific intent. We investigated this preference experimentally by presenting six orangutans, five gorillas, nine chimpanzees, and four bonobos with a food begging situation in which we varied the body orientation of an experimenter (E) with respect to the subject (front vs. back) and the location of the food (in front or behind E). These manipulations allowed us to measure whether subjects preferred to move around to face E or to use signals to attract her attention before they begged for food. Results showed that all species moved around to face E and then produced visual gestures, instead of using tactile/ auditory gestures behind E to call her attention. Species differences were apparent particularly when the food and E were in different locations. Unlike gorillas and orangutans, chimpanzees and bonobos (from genus Pan) produced their gestures in front of E in all conditions, including that in which subjects had to leave the food behind to communicate with her. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of the evolution of social cognition in great apes.

22445407;pi355;Manual deixis in apes and humans;Leavens D A;Journal Article;Pointing by apes is near-ubiquitous in captivity, yet rare in their natural habitats. This has implications for understanding both the ontogeny and heritability of pointing, conceived as a behavioral phenotype. The data suggest that the cognitive capacity for manual deixis was possessed by the last common ancestor of humans and the great apes. In this review, nonverbal reference is distinguished from symbolic reference. An operational definition of intentional communication is delineated, citing published or forthcoming examples for each of the denning criteria from studies of manual gestures in apes. Claims that chimpanzees do not point amongst themselves or do not gesture declaratively are refuted with published examples. Links between pointing and cognitive milestones in other domains relating means to ends are discussed. Finally, an evolutionary scenario of pointing as an adaptation to changes in hominid development is briefly sketched.

22445404;pi356;Emotional communication in primates: Implications for neurobiology;"Parr L A; Waller  M; Fugate J";Journal Article;The social brain hypothesis proposes that large neocortex size in Homonoids evolved to cope with the increasing demands of complex group living and greater numbers of interindividual relationships. Group living requires that individuals communicate effectively about environmental and internal events. Recent data have highlighted the complexity of chimpanzee communication, including graded facial expressions and referential vocalizations. Among Hominoids, elaborate facial communication is accompanied by specializations in brain areas controlling facial movement. Finally, the evolution of empathy, or emotional awareness, might have a neural basis in specialized cells in the neocortex, that is, spindle cells that have been associated with self-conscious emotions, and mirror neurons that have recently been shown to activate in response to communicative facial gestures.

22445645;pi357;Dominance, Status Signals and Coloration in Male Mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx);"Setchell J; Wickings E";Journal Article;Where individuals contest access to a resource, escalated physical fighting presents a risk to all involved. The requirement for mechanisms of conflict management has led to the evolution of a variety of decision rules and signals that act to reduce the frequency of aggression during competitive encounters. We examined strategies of conflict management in male mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) living in two semi-free-ranging groups in Gabon. Adult male mandrills are large (31 kg), with long canines, making the costs of conflict potentially very high. We found that males formed dominance hierarchies, but that male-male relationships were characterized by avoidance, appeasement and ignoring. Fights were rare, but could result in death. Examination of the relationship between dominance and signaling showed that males use facial and gestural signals to communicate dominance and subordinance, avoiding escalated conflict. Male mandrills also possess rank-dependent red coloration on the face, rump and genitalia, and we examined the hypothesis that this coloration acts as a 'badge of status', communicating male fighting ability to other males. If this is the case, then similarity in color should lead to higher dyadic rates of aggression, while males that differ markedly should resolve encounters quickly, with the paler individual retreating. Indeed, appeasement (the 'grin' display), threats, fights and tense 'stand-off' encounters were significantly more frequent between similarly colored males, while clear submission was more frequent where color differences were large. We conclude that male mandrills employ both formal behavioral indicators of dominance and of subordination, and may also use relative brightness of red coloration to facilitate the assessment of individual differences in fighting ability, thereby regulating the degree of costly, escalated conflict between well-armed males.

22445434;pi358;Even broken clocks are right twice a day: The utility of models in the clinical reasoning process;"Rodriguez A D; Rothi L J G";Journal Article;The use of cognitive neuropsychological models in rehabilitation has been widely debated among professionals in a variety of disciplines. Some believe that models can be used to develop 'model-based' treatment, while others maintain that the role of models in rehabilitation is more limited in scope. Despite the debate, it is widely accepted that models do contribute to the rehabilitation process. While models can assist in clinical decision making, it is important to understand the underlying assumptions of the model and be aware that the 'truth' of a model is something we seek and rarely achieve, and this evolution remains a continuing process. This article compares the Praxis Model of Rothi and Heilman (1997) and the Sketch Model of de Ruiter (1998), highlighting the contrasting underlying assumptions regarding the relationship of gesture and language. The limitations of these models is then used as segue for the discussion of the current debate regarding cognitive neuropsychological models and rehabilitation. We conclude with our view that models are assistive rather than directive.

22445367;pi359;Cracking the Nonverbal Code: Intercultural Competence and Gesture Recognition Across Cultures;"Molinsky A; Krabbenhoft M; Ambady N; Choi Y S";Journal Article;The purpose of this set of studies was to assess whether the ability to distinguish between real and fake gestures in a foreign setting is positively associated with cultural adjustment to that setting. To do so, we created an original videotaped measure of gesture recognition accuracy (the GRT). Study 1 (n = 508) found positive associations between performance on the GRT and length of stay in the foreign setting and between GRT performance and self-reported intercultural communication competence. Study 2 (n = 60) replicated the positive association between GRT performance and self-reported intercultural communication competence. It also found a positive association between GRT performance and external perceptions of intercultural communication competence and motivation as rated by observers native to the new cultural setting. Together, findings from the two studies highlight the importance of gesture recognition in the cultural adaptation process and the potential of the GRT measure as a useful assessment tool.

22445451;pi360;Mirror neurons, vocal imitation, and the evolution of particulate speech;Studdert-Kennedy M;Book Chapter;Proposes an evolutionary path from manual to facial to vocal imitation that rests on the hypothesis that all 3 modes of imitation are mediated by mirror neuron systems of representation. Three hypotheses are elaborated: (1) mirror neurons exist in humans as components of mirror systems that support recognition and replication of the actions of a conspecific, (2) facial imitation is supported by a specialized mirror system, and (3) vocal imitation co-opted and perhaps coevolved with the facial mirror system. Issues discussed include the particulate structure of language, articulate phonology and gestures as units of phonetic function, and behavioral evidence for gestures from speech errors. Evidence for the latter comes from the study in adults of random speech errors, and children's systematic speech errors in natural imitations of early words. Also discussed are the somatopic organization of phonetic gestures, correspondences between facial and vocal imitation in infants, and the path from analog face and cry to particulate speech.

22445552;pi361;Joint visual attention in infancy;Butterworth G;Book Chapter;This reprinted chapter originally appeared in G. Bremner & A. Fogel (Eds.), Blackwell handbook of infant development (pp. 213-40). 2001, Oxford: Blackwell. (The following abstract of the original chapter appeared in record [rid]2002-02376-008[/rid].) Shows that gaze and whole-body orientation serve widely as signals in the animal kingdom. Comparisons with primates show that species differences emerge strongly only when manual pointing is separated out from the complex of bodily orienting movements that serve as signals for joint visual attention (JVA). Even though chimpanzees can produce gestures that are morphologically similar to those of humans, they do not appear to interpret pointing as referential and actually seem to prefer gaze and trunk cues as signals rather than the pointing hand. Pointing in humans is intimately connected with species-typical handedness, with the precision grip, and with the acquisition of language. It is one of a set of indicative gestures, some of which overlap with those of the higher primates, but on the evidence to date, only humans use the pointing gesture declaratively to share attention with conspecifics. Pointing serves to refer as precisely as possible to objects in the periphery of vision for joint attention, cases for which eye and head movements do not provide accurate information about location. Pointing serves not only to individuate an object but also to authorize the link between the object and speech from the baby's perspective.

22445581;pi362;The embodied sense of music: Case studies on the rhetorical function of bodily gestures;Maruyama S;Journal Article;The present study illustrates a role that the bodily gesture plays in the production of musical artistry. I especially focused on its expressive (i.e. rhetorical) function, which enables musicians to effectively realize and communicate their musical interpretations. Prom interviews with musicians ranging in level from student to professional, and from observations of conductor's gestures videotaped in orchestra rehearsals, I report three cases showing how essential the sense of bodily movement contributes to finding the appropriate expression of music. In case 1, an interview with a pianist/conductor, Ryusuke Numajiri, I demonstrate examples of gesture embedded in music composition that constrains hand shape in the context of piano playing. According to Numajiri, such a habit very likely reflects each composer's motor capacity or preference of finger patterning, which makes a pianist's hands and fingers form 'composer-specific' motion patterns. In case 2, through observations of videotaped data on expressive gestures shown by two conductors, Myong-Whun Chung and Tetsuro Ban, I compare features of their gestures when they conduct the same piece. Results showed that, at the same point of the piece, both conductors represented nuances of the sound with very similar gestures, suggesting that the character of the musical sound has an intrinsic tendency to arouse a specific (similar) type of bodily gesture. In case 3, I introduce examples of bodily movements executed by a conductor, Uriel Segal, which produced an intended musical atmosphere. My main finding was that he clearly demonstrated that conductor's gestures, including beating motions all embody musical requirements that lead the orchestra in the proper direction. Further, I observed that his conducting also displayed a sense of being still, 'how to stop moving the body' at some points in the music as well as a sense of being in motion at other times. Discussion of all the findings suggests that there is an intrinsic link between musical expression and bodily sense, which I believe offers insight into the origins of music and experience of musical artistry.

22444930;pi363;The neurology of sign language;Gordon N;Journal Article;Forms of sign language have developed in a number of countries. American Sign Language, which originated from French signing, has been most extensively researched. As sign language is based on gestures executed in space and perceived visually it might be thought that it would mainly be a function of the right cerebral hemisphere when this is the non-dominant one. A number of studies are reviewed showing that sign language is a language in its own right and therefore, as with spoken language, its primary site of organization is in the dominant hemisphere. This does not mean that there is not a significant contribution from the other hemisphere with an interplay between the two. Each research project usually contributes some facet of knowledge apart from the main conclusions. These included the importance of distinguishing signs from gestures, the localization of different types of signing within the left dominant cerebral hemisphere, the fact that lesions of the right non-dominant hemisphere, although not causing a loss of signing will result in dyspraxia, and that aphasic symptoms of signing and speech are not modality dependant but reflected a disruption of language processes common to all languages. Examples are given of discoveries made by the use of the newer neuroradiological techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, and no doubt these will lead to further advances in knowledge. The use of sign language in the treatment of patients with verbal aphasia is considered, especially of children with the Landau-Kleffner syndrome, but therapy of this kind can be used in children with delayed language development, and in other types of acquired aphasia at any age. Other methods of treatment than signing, such as cochlear implants may be increasingly used in the future, but it seems likely that sign language will continue to be a dominant feature in the deaf culture.

22445168;pi364;Conference reports;"Liebal K; Muller C";Journal Article;David McNeill, Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Linguistics at the University of Chicago, was honored with a Festschrift conference on June 8th, 2003. His retirement follows a remarkable career of some 40 years, built of highly original contributions to many areas of psycholinguistic research. The fields represented by the presenters and audience at the conference include psychology, linguistics, anthropology, music cognition and theory, neuroscience, medicine, computer science, and engineering. McNeill has been best known for his study of the role of gesture in human language. Observations of two kinds first sparked McNeill's interest in coverbal gesture. One was the vivid yet highly individualistic gesturing in conversation he witnessed among mathematician colleagues of his during his tenure at Princeton University's Institute for Advanced Studies. Another was gestures that children produce across the stages of their language development. McNeill's is a unique intellect and his contributions to language research and theory have been consistently innovative and influential over the years. It was a desire to recognize this quality that motivated his current and former students to organize a Festschrift conference, in order to illuminate the impact of his work on diverse fields of language research.

22445560;pi365;The frame/content theory of evolution of speech: A comparison with a gestural-origins alternative;"MacNeilage P F; Davis B L";Journal Article;The Frame/Content theory deals with how and why the first language evolved the present-day speech mode of programming syllable 'Frame' structures with segmental (consonant and vowel) 'Content' elements. The first words are considered, for biomechanical reasons, to have had the simple syllable frame structures of pre-speech babbling (e.g., 'bababa'), and were perhaps parental terms, generated within the parent-infant dyad. Although all gestural origins theories (including Arbib's theory reviewed here) have iconicity as a plausible alternative hypothesis for the origin of the meaning- signal link for words, they all share the problems of how and why a fully fledged sign language, necessarily involving a structured phonology, changed to a spoken language.

22445089;pi367;The rooting of the mind in the body: New links between attachment theory and psychoanalytic thought;"Fonagy P; Target M";Journal Article;The relationship between psychoanalysis and attachment theory is complex indeed. A brief review of the psychoanalytic literature as it concerns attachment theory and research, and of the attachment literature as it pertains to psychoanalytic ideas, demonstrates an increasing interest in attachment theory within psychoanalysis. Some of the difficulties that attachment theory faces in relation to psychoanalytic ideas are traced to its links to the now dated cognitive science of the 1960s and 1970s. Today, however, a second-generation cognitive neuroscience seeks neurobiologically plausible accounts in which links with brain and body are seen as shaping mind and consciousness, which increasingly are seen as 'embodied,' as emerging from or serving the needs of a physical being located in a specific time, place, and social context. This idea has also been at the core of much psychoanalytic thinking, which has historically affirmed the rootedness of symbolic thought in sensory, emotional, and enacted experience with objects. Now neurobiological advances supporting the concept of embodied cognition offer an opportunity to forge powerful links between the hitherto separate domains of attachment theory and psychoanalysis. Speculations about the nature of language are presented that emphasize the origin of internal working models (and of representations in general) in early sensorimotor and emotional experiences with a caregiver. It is argued that language and symbolic thought may be phylogenetically and ontogenetically embodied, built on a foundation of gestures and actions, and are thus profoundly influenced by the experience of early physical interaction with the primary object. Finally, the clinical and research implications of these ideas are discussed.

22445197;pi368;'Playful' therapy: Working with autism and trauma;Barrows P;Book Chapter;Some autistic children who have been seen in psychotherapy have shown very little progress despite intensive input over many years, and have not recovered their capacity to play. What I do wish to suggest, though, is that there may be a sub-group of autistic children for whom this form of psychotherapy is particularly appropriate. The group I have in mind is that originally identified by Reid. She described a sub-group of autistic children comprised of those who appear to have resorted to autistic defences in the face of overwhelming trauma. She calls this group Autistic Post-Traumatic Developmental Disorder. I shall describe my work with a 3-yr-old boy who I believe fits into this group. I want now to give a brief overview of Stephen's therapy and to try and convey some of the ways in which he has changed over these three years. The changes have been quite dramatic. The Stephen I see today is extremely verbal, chats away to the receptionist in our clinic when he arrives, and readily engages in symbolic play in the consulting room. The stereotyped gestures have virtually disappeared. His language is at times still hard to understand, and there are features in his play that still give cause for concern, but he is nonetheless a transformed child. Introducing aggression, aggression and sibling rivalry,  benign doctors, the impact of trauma and trauma, aggression and language in the therapeutic process are discussed.  The author concludes with therapeutic implications. This paper was published in the International Forum of Psychoanalysis, 2004, 13 (see record [rid]2004-18525-006[/rid]).

22445302;pi369;Linguistic influences on gesture's form;"Gerwing J; Bavelas J";Journal Article;"Hand gestures in face-to-face dialogue are symbolic acts, integrated with speech. Little is known about the factors that determine the physical form of these gestures. When the gesture depicts a previous nonsymbolic action, it obviously resembles this action; however, such gestures are not only noticeably different from the original action but, when they occur in a series, are different from each other. This paper presents an experiment with two separate analyses (one quantitative, one qualitative) testing the hypothesis that the immediate communicative function is a determinant of the symbolic form of the gesture. First, we manipulated whether the speaker was describing the previous action to an addressee who had done the same actions and therefore shared common ground or to one who had done different actions and therefore did not share common ground. The common ground gestures were judged to be significantly less complex, precise, or informative than the latter, a finding similar to the effects of common ground on words. In the qualitative analysis, we used the given versus new principle to analyze a series of gestures about the same actions by the same speaker. The speaker emphasized the new information in each gesture by making it larger, clearer, etc. When this information became given, a gesture for the same action became smaller or less precise, which is similar to findings for given versus new information in words. Thus the immediate communicative function (e.g., to convey information that is common ground or that is new) played a major role in determining the physical form of the gestures.

22445646;pi370;L'organisation soi/autrui dans le d�veloppement psychologique humain;"Aitken K J; Trevarthen C";Journal Article;Evidence from the evolution of human cultural behavior and learning, embryology and genetics of the brain, and the behavior of human infants indicates that the critical and uniquely human motives for cooperative imagination and joint interest in objects and tasks are determined by expression of genes and epigenetic neural systems elaboration long before birth, along with essential peripheral organs of perception and motor expression that will serve in communication by rhythmic facial, vocal, gestural, and body movement signals. These cerebral motives continue to exercise their influence on neural development and behavior throughout life, transforming the behaviors of the developing individual through a succession of phases to which other individuals and cultural institutions are constrained to adapt. We discuss the theory of innate intersubjectivity and relate it to the hypothesis of an 'Innate Motive Formation' that emerges in brain development as regulator of morphogenesis in neural systems, and that continues to function, postnatally, as generator of motives and emotions by which human contacts and relationships are regulated. We suggest that differentiates of the primary motive formation in the embryo brain later serve to generate intelligent exploration of the objective environment, and the emergence of an additional dialogic mechanism that represents the self-subject as a partner for an other-subject, intersubjectively. Intersubjective communication in infancy leads, through systematic age-related transformations of the brain and behavior, to preverbal mimetic negotiation of cooperative awareness and joint task performance. Finally we discuss, in relation to this theory, interpretations of faulty communication and development at different stages of the life cycle that result from maternal postnatal depression, autism, premature birth, and schizophrenia.

The latter is the domain of significant communicative interaction that goes beyond gestures and toward symbolic meanings. Domains of communication underwrite emergent forms of social organization and social psychology that typify human society.

22445686;pi372;On gestural mimicry;Kimbara I;Journal Article;Despite various theories about the exact origin of gestures in speech production, researchers generally accept that gesture and speech constitute the product of a single unit of thought within the speaker. On the other hand, what I call gestural mimicry requires consideration of factors outside such speaker-internal coupling of gesture and speech. Through detailed analysis of a joint narration task and casual conversation in a dyad, I will show that, once perceived and decoded by a partner, the form-meaning relationship of a speaker's gesture can become part of the common ground of understanding between the participants. In gestural mimicry, communicativity is observed in the way a speaker's spontaneous gesture shapes the subsequent gestural move of the interlocutor. With a recurrence of gestural features across speakers, image construal through gesture becomes an interactional phenomenon. That is, gesture as well as speech provides an interactional resource for co-constructing talk.

22445139;pi373;Early signs related to posture and communication: The child's attitude, and the mother's reaction;Danon-Boileau L;Book Chapter;"The aim of this chapter is to point out a certain number of signs that could indicate future difficulties in the domain of communication and interaction. In this respect, it is clear that a sign is not necessarily a predictor of autism; it is only the possible mark of difficulties to come. And, of course, there are children who originally present with some of the signs we are trying to spot but who later come back to normal and no longer exhibit any disturbances. The data on which we are working are family videos of children who have been diagnosed as autistic at the age of 4 years. Research into early signs of autism is now commonly carried out. However, we have a certain number of specific ways of treating the problem. First, we are interested in very young children. And, of course, the younger the child is, the more the signs that the observer has to focus on are related to the child's tonus and posture, because when the child is very young, signs related to preverbal and communicative behaviour (gaze and smile) are restricted. Second, we think that the signs are not only visible on the child's part: a child whose interaction is problematic tends to alter his or her mother's gestures and speech (syntax and intonation). The communication of the mother is itself also very revealing, and, in fact, her reaction to the child's peculiarities is sometimes more visible than the peculiarities of the child him/herself. In this chapter, we outline our research protocol and present the data that we have gathered from a comparison between two sisters, one of whom turned out to be autistic, the other normal. We have undertaken a thorough analysis of two parallel and contrasting situations, involving a mother giving a bath to her daughters: first, Julie at 5 months of age; and then, two years later, Tiphaine at 3 months of age. The 'same' scene is therefore filmed with each child, and allows comparison. The difference in age is of no importance, as it is Julie, the elder one, who will later turn out to be autistic, and not Tiphaine.

22445596;pi374;Nonverbal metaphor: A review of theories and evidence;Seitz Jay A ;Journal Article;"Traditional approaches to metaphor�the received view�have viewed metaphor as largely a property of language behavior. As a result, theories of metaphoric processes have been overly parochial, evidencing an inability to explain various phenomena that may share similar underlying processes. In the present article, three accounts of metaphor are reviewed: the language view, the synesthetic view, and the cognitive (symbol systems) view. Various lines of evidence are offered in support of the cognitive approach: prelinguistic evidence (including studies of metaphor-in-action), physiognomic perception, and evolutionary considerations; studies of children's comprehension and use of spatial, gestural, and pictorial metaphor; studies of adults' use of gestural representation; and evidence from studies of injury to the brain. Various theories of nonverbal metaphor are reviewed, with special attention given to visual metaphor, including illustrations from art theorists and historians and arguments from philosophers. Finally, the issue of visual metaphor is framed within a more general theory of visual thinking.

22444916;pi376;Hemispheric specialization for language: Brain volume matters;"Josse G; Herve P; Crivello F; Mazoyer B; Tzourio-Mazoyer N ";Journal Article;Increasing brain volume may impose constraints, through longer information transfer delays, on the distributed networks supporting language. Here, we assessed the relative effects of brain volume and other putative predictors of the functional variability of perisylvian language areas, as probed with PET, during both a language comprehension and a language production task. In the case of language comprehension (story listening), a linear combination of planum temporale surface, brain volume and handedness could explain almost 60% of the functional asymmetry observed in the perisylvian area. Without brain volume, the goodness of fit was significantly decreased (39%, P < 0.05), and furthermore, the effect of handedness was not detected anymore. This was due to the fact that in our sample, left-handers (n = 12) had a significantly larger brain volume as compared to right-handers (n = 8, P = 0.03). As for language production (verb generation), brain volume and the planum temporale also played a role. However, in this case, the main predictor of functional variability was handedness, where a greater degree of right-handedness was associated with larger activation of left inferior frontal regions. Depending on the language component of interest, these results support different (yet compatible) theories on hemispheric specialization. Left specialization for comprehension could be attributed to the constraints of processing speech stimuli, while a gestural origin of language is mostly supported by the relation we observed between left specialization for production and right-handedness.

22445047;pi377;Gestural expression, perception and language: A discussion of the ideas of Johan Jakob Engel;Fortuna S;Journal Article;This paper discusses J. J. Engel's theory of mimicry, which is part of a broad discussion within German philosophy in late 1700 about physiognomies i.e. human bodily expression and perception. The core of Engel's investigation consists in a theory of human gesture which avoid both the conventional and the physiological elements and focuses on the semantic and reflective components. The author shows how this reflection about the symbolic devices involved in gestural comprehension and communication develop a parallel reflection about the origin and functioning of verbal processes of communication.

22445207;pi378;The lexicon of the Conductor's face;Poggi I;Book Chapter;Analyzes the communicative functions of the Conductor's gaze, head movements and facial expression, trying to show that these expressive signals are not idiosyncratic at all but very consistent and systematic indeed, to the extent that it is possible to write down a lexicon of them, a list of expressive items where each gaze or facial signal corresponds to a precise meaning. The author begins by trying to figure out what are the meanings a Conductor may have to communication, and what gaze, face and head signals are generally devoted to communicate them. The author then presents a procedure for the transcription and analysis of multimodal communication that is called 'the musical score' of the vocal, gestural, facial, bodily communication, and adapts it to the analysis of some fragments of Conductors' communicative behavior, to test whether the signals hypothesized in the first part are in fact used in real conducting. Finally, the author outlines a lexicon of the Conductor's face and concludes by discussing some general problems in the theory of communication regarding the mechanisms of polysemy and diachronic evolution of signals.

22444934;pi379;A descriptive analysis of pointing and oral movements in a home sign system;"Torigoe T; Takei W";Journal Article;In this article the authors describe some aspects of the structure of the home signs of 2 elderly deaf sisters (aged 71 and 68 yrs) who have had no formal schooling and who have had little contact with the deaf community. The authors focus especially on pointing gestures and oral movements. The sisters were visited and their home more than 10 times, each visit lasting for about 1 hour. At their home the authors observed their conversations with each other and tried to talk though a mixture of gesturing and Japanese Sign Language. The authors chose 20 minutes of typical conversation from the videotapes for quantitative analysis. One-third of the manual tokens (signs + pointing) were pointing, indicating that pointing was used very frequently in this home sign system. Qualitative analysis enabled the classification of pointing into 3 types according to function: referential, lexical, and grammatical. Oral movements occurred frequently in the home signs. Most oral movements co-occurred with manual parts of signed utterances, although only small parts of them occurred independently with manual parts. Some of the oral movements originated from the words of the spoken language.

22445703;pi380;The executive functions and self-regulation: An evolutionary neuropsychological perspective;Barkley R A;Journal Article;The author encourages neuropsychologists to contemplate the longer-term, functional nature of the executive functions (EFs), using an evolutionary perspective. For purely illustrative purposes, a previously developed model of the EFs is presented and examined from an evolutionary perspective. That model views the EFs as forms of behavior-to-the-self that evolved from overt to covert responses as a means of self-regulation. That was necessary given the interpersonal competition that arises within this group-living species. The EFs serve to shift the control of behavior from the immediate context, social others, and the temporal now to self-regulation by internal representations regarding the hypothetical social future. The EFs seem to meet the requirements of a biological adaptation, being an improbable complex design for a purpose that exists universally in humans. Discovering the adaptive problems that the EFs evolved to solve offers an invaluable research agenda for neuropsychology lest that agenda be resolved first by other scientific disciplines. Some adaptive problems that the EFs may have evolved to solve are then considered, among them being social exchange, imitation and vicarious learning as types of experiential theft, and mimetic skill and gestural communication.

Ribes and F. Lopez, as stated in their book, 'Theory of behavior: field-and parametric analysis' (1985). In it, the authors develop the concept of horizontal development at the referential level. The Ribes and Lopez model of linguistic behavior incorporates some of Vygotsky's original ideas on the higher psychological processes (1979). Topics addressed, structured around speaking-writing relationships, include the development of verbal language from nonverbal (e.g., gestural) communication; results of experimental studies with children (no demographics given) on linguistic behavior. These studies involved reading texts and relating their contents to others. Skinner's categories of verbal behavior (1957) are also discussed.

22445656;pi382;Family process and individual evolution;Gagnarli L;Book Chapter;Listening is fundamental to the analyst's role. Listening means accepting the patient's communication and giving meaning to the words that are said. The listening attitude fosters engagement in the encounter between patient and therapist and facilitates the emergence of transference. It creates conditions that make it possible to stage and unravel the unconscious web of fantasies underlying the emotional pain and the symptoms that prompt the patient to seek help. Listening is also fundamental to the family therapist's role, but since the patient is now a group of people, there are some additional aspects to the listening. In work with couples and families, much of the listening attitude is focused on the visuals. Body language and gestures deserve particular attention. The nonverbal aspects intertwine with the verbal exchanges to lend more, or less, congruity to what is being said and to establish alliances or conflicts which trigger intense feelings.

22445408;pi383;Social games between bonobos and humans: Evidence for shared intentionality?;"Pika S; Zuberbuhler K";Journal Article;Triadic social games are interesting from a cognitive perspective because they require a high degree of mutual social awareness. They consist of two agents incorporating an object in turn-taking sequences and require individuals to coordinate their attention to the task, the object, and to one another. Social games are observed commonly in domesticated dogs interacting with humans, but they have received only little empirical attention in nonhuman primates. Here, we report observations of bonobos (Pan paniscus) engaging in social games with a human playmate. Our behavioral analyses revealed that the bonobos behaved in many ways similar to human children during these games. They were interested in the joint activity, rather than the play objects themselves, and used communicative gestures to encourage reluctant partners to perform their role, suggesting rudimentary understanding of others' intentions. Our observations thus may imply that shared intentionality, the ability to understand and shares intention with other individuals, has emerged in the primate lineage before the origins of hominids.

22445723;pi384;Apraxia;"Binkofski F; Reetz K";Book Chapter;Apraxias are deficits of higher motor behaviour that are not primarily caused by elementary deficits of the sensorimotor system, communication problems, or dementia. The patients present with deficits in imitating meaningful or meaningless gestures, purposeful use of objects, or dexterity. The different forms of apraxia originate from lesions of different levels/structures of the motor system, reflecting its complexity. Apraxias are caused by deficits in motor programmes generated in the frontal motor areas (executive apraxias, e.g. limb-kinetic apraxia), in the modality-specific higher sensorimotor control (unimodal apraxias, e.g. tactile apraxia, optic apraxia), or at the highest level of motor planning and motor conception (polymodal apraxias, i.e. ideomotor and ideational apraxias). Polymodal apraxias typically result from left hemisphere lesions and are therefore often, but not necessarily, observed in combination with aphasia. The different types of apraxia differentially affect the activities of daily living and hence show marked differences in the prognosis of recovery and the need of physiotherapeutic treatment. Therefore, diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the different forms of apraxia is of foremost clinical importance.

22445679;pi385;The process of remembering: Recovery and discovery;Fonagy I;Journal Article;"Experiences of gradually recovering lost memories may shed some light on the cognitive mechanism underlying remembering. We (1) easily remember the external frame (the context) of the lost memory; (2) experience the emergence of its internal frame (category or genre); (3) recall its configuration, its rhythmic skeleton or its dynamic structure; (4) and even sketch it by a gesture; (5) recall our evaluation of the person or our impression of the event we cannot remember; (6) find the central object may emerge in a disguised (symbolic) form; (7) find the abortive first attempt to reconstruct the lost memory may contain an unconscious interpretation of the hidden event or the forgotten dream. Gradual remembering follows on the whole the path of verbal evolution. Trying to recapture lost memories we are compelled to make use of preverbal forms of mental elaboration and expression (visual thinking, gesture language, symbols). At the same time, recovery of lost memories has much in common with the procedure of scientific discovery. Discovery could be considered as a paradoxical form of remembering: recovering the unknown. Scientific metaphors uncover ('remember') preconscious and unconscious knowledge.

22444810;pi386;Searching for language: Process, not product;Wilcox S;Journal Article;Discusses the contributions of W. C. Stokoe to the understanding of American Sign Language (ASL) as a language. The study of the signed language of deaf people can tell us about the nature of language, and from this work Stokoe developed an account of the gestural theory of language. The perspective that Stokoe adopted in his approach to the study of ASL and language in general is presented in three of his papers�'Where Should We Look for Language?', 'Sign Language versus Spoken Language', and 'Semantic Phonology'. The present author suggests that Stokoe's contributions in the area of semantic phonology are his most significant in that it captures the essence of his view of the structure of signed languages, but also of his argument for the gestural origin of language.

22445699;pi387;The chameleon effect as social glue: Evidence for the evolutionary significance of nonconscious mimicry;"Lakin J; Jefferis V; Cheng C; Chartrand T";Journal Article;The 'chameleon effect' refers to the tendency to adopt the postures, gestures, and mannerisms of interaction partners (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999). This type of mimicry occurs outside of conscious awareness, and without any intent to mimic or imitate. Empirical evidence suggests a bi-directional relationship between nonconscious mimicry on the one hand, and liking, rapport, and affiliation on the other. That is, nonconscious mimicry creates affiliation, and affiliation can be expressed through nonconscious mimicry. We argue that mimicry played an important role in human evolution. Initially, mimicry may have had survival value by helping humans communicate. We propose that the purpose of mimicry has now evolved to serve a social function. Nonconscious behavioral mimicry increases affiliation, which serves to foster relationships with others. We review current research in light of this proposed framework and suggest future areas of research.

A realistic simulation of an interaction system, using the Wizard of Oz experimental paradigm was designed. Eight subjects performed various design tasks, using this simulated user interface during 3 weekly sessions. Analysis of the audiovisual protocols suggests great interindividual differences in styles of expression and strategies for combining speech with gestures. Styles of expression can be divided according to the nature of the relationships between the Ss and the system: communication with a machine interlocutor or manipulation of a graphical representation of the application. After a short initial adaptation phase, confined to the 1st scenario or to the 1st session, the styles of most Ss did not evolve. A few instances of later evolution were observed which point to interindividual differences relating to the capability of transferring competencies acquired in the context of human communication to a human�computer interaction environment.

23080845;pi389;Onset of voluntary communication: Smiling looks to mother;"Jones S; Hong H";Journal Article;Playing infants often direct smiling looks toward social partners. In some cases the smile begins before the look, so it cannot be a response to the sight or behavior of the social partner. In this study we asked whether smiles that anticipate social contact are used by 8- to 12-month-old infants as voluntary social signals. Eighty infants�20 at each of 8, 9, 10, and 12 mo of age�completed 5 tasks. The tasks assessed anticipatory smiling during toy play, means-end understanding (2 tasks), intentional communication via gesture and vocalizations, and memory for mother's location. Across all ages, anticipatory smiling was strongly predicted by intentional gestural and vocal communication and by means-end understanding. The findings are discussed in terms of the nature and origins of infants' voluntary communications.

22445717;pi390;Preconditions for the evolution of protolanguages;Donald M;Book Chapter;Argues that hominids could not have evolved a capacity for 'protolanguage' without meeting at least 2 preconditions. The first is the prior evolution of a more powerful central motor capacity that gave hominids a degree of voluntary movement control that does not exist in any other species. This new motor-modelling skill, or 'mimesis,' allowed them to vary and elaborate upon the entire voluntary motor repertoire of the primate line. However, their communication use at this preliminary stage was probably restricted to action-metaphor, mime, and rudimentary gesture. The second precondition is the evolution of a more abstract capacity for expressive modelling, one that did not rely entirely on perceptual metaphor as the carrier of conventional meaning. In evolution, this second step provided the cognitive mechanism needed to construct the other side of the lexical entry, or lemma, and elevated the morphological inventiveness of hominids to a truly linguistic level. This innovation, probably first found in nascent form in early sapients, would have triggered the structural basis for evolving a capacity for lexical invention and the first protolanguages.

22445715;pi391;Do children with autism understand imitation as intentional interaction?;Nadel J;Journal Article;Synchronic imitation generates a unique phenomenon with multiple outcomes: seeing one's intentions acted through the behaviour of the other. In the past we have shown that imitation and imitation recognition allow preverbal infants to find common topics based on similar actions, and to take conversational turns by alternating the roles of imitator and model. Therefore the gap between recognizing actions and coding messages with communicative intent is not as enormous as it looks at first glance: Understanding the other's intentional actions is prepared by the use of the imitative system, via the action recognition mechanism. In this paper, we review earlier results with typical preverbal children and stress the importance of imitation in the sociocognitive development of nonverbal children with autism. Using a design which allows us to evaluate spontaneous imitation, we have found that even very low-functioning children with autism mostly produce spontaneous imitations in socially embedded situations. The imitations produced are simple gestural matching or imitations of familiar or novel actions that are goal-directed and involve affordant or non-affordant objects. They are a good predictor of social capacities. They enhance attention to persons and expectancies for social contingencies. Repeated imitative sessions improve imitation, recognition of being imitated, and nonverbal communication. Through being imitated low-functioning children with autism start understanding that they can be at the origin of intentional actions of others. This was shown through the use of a revisited version of the Still Face paradigm consisting in a still episode of a stranger followed by an imitative interaction initiated by the stranger and ending with a second still face: all children reacted to the second still face as a violation of intentional exchanges, while they had no protest during the first.

22444859;pi392;The fatal smirk: Insider accounts of organizational change processes in a police organization;"Jacobs G; Keegan A; Christe-Zeyse J; Seeberg I; Runde B";Journal Article;Purpose: The key to success and failure in change projects may lie not in groundbreaking events or heroic gestures but in the many seemingly meaningless acts and events that occur throughout all change projects. In order to gain a better understanding of factors leading to success in change projects, the purpose of this paper is to examine insider accounts of successful and unsuccessful change projects in a non-business public context, namely the German police. Design/methodology/approach: The research can be located in the exploratory, inductive research tradition and consistent with that we used in-depth semi-structured interviews to elicit the views of 92 high potential future managers as to what constitutes a(n) (un)successful project, and what factors lead to (un)successful project outcomes. Findings: The qualitative approach adopted allows for the tracing of a range social behavioural issues identified by members of the organization as criteria to evaluate the success of projects-commitment of peers and superiors, satisfaction of members with the outcome. Identifying factors leading to project success, participants identified the following-clear communication of both positive and potentially negative outcomes, commitment of leaders, and changes in work conditions resulting from the project. Research limitations/implications: Social and behavioural aspects of change projects, which are often relegated to a secondary position behind managerial and technical aspects, should be taken into account more often in (research on) change management projects. Originality/value: The findings are based on research that explicitly integrates the mundane aspects, the daily mistakes and the routine obstacles facing those involved in change projects and suggests the value of incorporating such issues in (research on) change management projects given the spread of projects from a traditional engineering context to a variety of different contexts including, increasingly, non-profit and governmental organizations.

22444903;pi393;The shadow of your smile: Intrusion or engulfment;Shank C;Book Chapter;The author's interest in infant observation studies grew from her clinical work with several adult patients who suffer from a chronic awareness of disconnection, frequent lapses into states of confusion, and an acute sense of feeling lost and unbounded. They seem to have no language for these experiences and have difficulty associating these phenomena with memories or current events, which suggests that the origins of their catastrophic anxiety and disorganization are preverbal. Observing infants, studying the mother-infant relationship, and reading the works of Meltzer, Rosenfeld, Winnicott, and eventually Bick helped the author to attend more carefully to nonverbal messages and the spontaneous gestures through which unconscious anxiety finds expression in adult psychotherapy patients. This chapter illustrates how the author has integrated her understanding from infant observation with her clinical work.

22445667;pi394;Hand, mouth and brain: The dynamic emergence of speech and gesture;"Iverson J M; Thelen E";Journal Article;The notion that the mind arises from having a body that interacts with the environment (embodiment) stands in contrast to the prevailing cognitivist view which uses a computer metaphor to describe the structure of the mind: that thought is the product of abstract mental symbols and the rules by which they are mentally manipulated. This paper examines the embodiment of one foundational aspect of human cognition, language, through its bodily association with the gestures that accompany its expression in speech. The authors propose that speech and gesture have their developmental origins in early hand�mouth linkages. The initial sensorimotor linkages of these systems form the bases for their later cognitive interdependence. The authors defend their proposition with neurophysiological data demonstrating the close link between language and movement. The motor actions of hand and mouth are present from birth and evolve in a mutually interactive fashion during the first year of life.

22445761;pi395;Cerebral asymmetry: Motoring on;Corballis M C;Journal Article;I argue that the phylogenetic and neurobiological bases for cerebral asymmetry in humans are likely to be found in motor systems rather than in perceptual systems. Current genetic models of human laterality suggest that a 'dextral' allele might be responsible for right-handedness and left-cerebral dominance for speech in the majority of humans. The linking of handedness with language lateralization might reflect the early evolution of language as predominantly a system of manual gestures, perhaps switching to a mainly vocal system only with the emergence of Homo sapiens. So-called 'mirror neurons' in the prefrontal cortex of the monkey, which fire both when the animal makes a grasping response and when it sees the same response performed by others, might be part of a circuit that is the precursor to language circuits in the brain. This circuit appears to be bilateral in monkeys, but left-hemispheric in humans.

23080837;pi397;Coherence in children's speech perception;"Nittrouer S; Crowther C S";Journal Article;"This study was originally undertaken to examine whether children would show the same patter of perceptual coherence for speech that adults showed in studies by H. Fitch et al (1980) and C. T. Best (1981). For this study stimuli was used that consisted of an [s] noise followed by a silent interval (as appropriate for a stop closure) and a vocalic portion. The results showed a strong coherence of separate acoustic cues in the speech perception of young children. An important development task facing young children is learning how to produce the articulatory gestures required of their native languages, and so these gestures are extremely relevant ecologically. Learning to strip off the individual acoustic properties is a perceptual skill that may only be required later. Thus, children do not discover phonetic coherence; instead, they learn to overcome it when necessary.

22445600;pi398;Mapping the range of information contained in the iconic hand gestures that accompany spontaneous speech;"Beattie G; Shovelton H";Journal Article;Tested D. McNeill's (1985) theory that the iconic gestures that accompany speech in everyday talk convey critical information in interpersonal communication. Using a structured interview to measure the amount of information respondents received from clause-length clips of a cartoon story, the authors discovered that when respondents (all undergraduates) could see the iconic gestures as well as hear the speech, they received significantly more accurate information about those aspects of the original story depicted in the clips than with speech alone. Only with respect to certain semantic categories, namely, the relative position and the size of objects, the beneficial effect of gestural communication was significant. It was then considered in detail how specific attributes of actions and of objects are communicated via the iconic representation within individual gestures. Lastly, the implications of these findings for models of human communication in this area are discussed.

22445672;pi399;Read My Lips: Asymmetries in the Visual Expression and Perception of Speech Revealed Through the McGurk Effect;"Nicholls M; Searle D; Bradshaw J";Journal Article;It is well known that the right side of the mouth moves more than the left during speech, but little is known about how this asymmetry affects lipreading. We investigated asymmetries in the visual expression and perception of speech using the McGurk effect--an illusion in which incongruent lip movements cause listeners to misreport sounds. Thirty right-handed participants watched film clips in which the left, the right, or neither side of the mouth was covered. The McGurk effect was attenuated when the right side of the mouth was covered, demonstrating that this side is more important to lipreading than is the left side of the mouth. Mirror-reversed images tested whether the asymmetry was the result of an observer bias toward the left hemispace. The McGurk effect was stronger in the normal than in the mirror orientation when the mouth was fully visible. Thus, observers attend more to what they think is the right side of the speaker's mouth. Asymmetries in mouth movements may reflect the gestural origins of language, which are also right lateralized.

22445649;pi400;Le jeu de transformation dans l'id�ogramme;Chan J;Journal Article;Ideographic writing, according to its principles of organization, is an analogical model for conceiving the construction of the human psyche. Languages, gesture, bodily attitudes, and sensory elements are the diverse aspects of figures of images and contribute to the dynamic and economic construction of intersubjectivity. The movement of the body contained in an ideogram inscribes identificatory processes in writing. The different components of an ideogram each occupy a place in the construction of the Ego and the Self. These transformations inside an ideogram portray the question of origins, of the difference between generations, of the sexes. The figures of images regroup or disperse themselves, like the dreamwork nourishing living breath, which is what I call the human being's animated being (anim�). The proximity between the approach of a clinical understanding of certain ideograms and formal signifiers such as described by Didier Anzieu, allow us to construct a representative model of the malleability of psychic conflictuality and to represent the dynamics of the processes of the visual unconscious. One can 'see' the transformations, folds and 'unfolds' of the economic dimension and dynamic position on considering formal signifiers and primary processes. Ideograms are constructed as a process of psychisation via the 'play' of transformation, from visual matter to psychic matter.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2000-13894-003[/rid].) This article examines the primacy of real-world bodily experience for understanding the human mind. The peculiarities of the living human brain and body, and the bodily experiences they sustain, are essential ingredients of human sense-making and conceptual systems. Conceptual systems are created, brought forth, understood, and sustained through very specific cognitive mechanisms ultimately grounded in bodily experience. They don't have a transcendental abstract logic independent of the species-specific bodily features. To defend this position, the author focuses on a case study: the fundamental concept of time flow. Using tools of cognitive linguistics, this concept is analyzed as it is manifested naturally in everyday language. There is a precise conceptual metaphor (mapping) whose inferential structure gives an account of a huge variety of linguistic expressions, semantic contents, and unconscious spontaneous gestures: Time Events Are Things In Space. This mechanism allows us to unconsciously, effortlessly, and precisely understand (and make inferences with) expressions such� (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved);Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Semiosis e intersubjetividad en el desarrollo humano;Espanol S;Journal Article;"This paper deals with the developmental semiotic theory put forward by Angel Rivi�re. First, Rivier�'s most original proposal is presented: a semiotic creation mechanism--known as suspension--which encompasses landmark developmental sign formations, namely: emotional expressions, first deictic gestures, enactive symbols, pretend play, and metaphorical comprehension. Then specific assumptions of the Semiotic Suspension Theory are discussed and related to crucial subject areas in research on semiotic processes, such as: the link between semiosis and intersubjectivity; the relation between communication, cognition, and semiosis; the role of both object and instrumental action in sign formation as well as in the unfolding of mentalistic abilities, among others. Finally, a possible extension of the theory is proposed, including a new suspension source and a complementary way of understanding the emotional world and its consequences.

It discusses relationships among gender, gesture, and power. The overwhelming bulk of sex-differentiated behavior is learned, and is developed to display otherwise unobtrusive differences. The same behaviors exhibited by a superior to a subordinate are those typically exhibited by males to females; females exhibit to males the behaviors typical of a subordinate to a superior. Power is particularly illuminated in relationships between males and females, including those often considered sexually based. Power and sexuality are often confused in society. Females can stop smiling unless they're happy, lowering or averting their eyes when stared at, and getting out of males' way in public. They can start staring people in the eye, addressing people by their first names, and being more relaxed in demeanor.

The variation is found in the severity of incidence and especially how they cope with their illness in an environment that - in regards to language, social organization, cultural memory, interests, and motivations - is different from their own. Therefore, the clinical manifestations of the neurological disorders are metasymptoms that should not misinterpreted. The symptoms and complaints shown by these patients should be understood in their context; more importantly, some of the behavioral gestures, or the way they express their feelings, are not symptoms, but references to their cultural origin.

In the analytic session, the patient's withdrawal manifested itself in the form of drowsiness, which frequently turned into sleep. This was frustrating for the analyst when she was unable to tell whether the patient listened to what she was saying. She attributed her patient's schizoid withdrawal to his use of the primitive mechanism of ego splitting. The analyst's interpretive approach, based on her countertransference and on the observation of the patient's gestures and onomatopoeias, allowed for evolution of the analytic process. The integrating interpretation of these split aspects must be channelled toward repairing the egoic functions. During the last year of analysis, the patient overcame his tendency to fall asleep at the sessions, and the possibility of genuine emotional communication improved.

22445121;pi408;On the evolution of language and generativity;Corballis M C;Journal Article;The evolution of language began 2 million yrs ago beginning as a system of manual gestures (in prehominid apes) progressing to a predominantly vocal mode with the emergence of Homo sapiens sapiens. This coincides with the gradual increase in brain size and the gradual prolongation of childhood. It was during this period that stone tool cultures developed, although they did not display the generativity and open endedness of contemporary manufacture. The emergence of vocal language freed the hands for the further development of manufacture and other manual pursuits. The evolutionary explosion heralded the application of generative principles that appeared 1st in the context of language and then in other kinds of activity.

Early in the second year, giving as a request to do something with an object increased, while emotive gestures decreased. Later in the second year, pointing gestures increased, while protest gestures tended to decrease. Combining gestures with vocalization tended to increase only for protest gestures later in the second year. Eye contact showed a small but continuous increase in coordination with gestures over the second year, particularly with comment, request, and emotive gestures. These findings indicate an increasing use of the parent as an agent of the informative function in non-verbal communication during this period of transition to verbal communication.

In Exp 1, infants remembered the syllable�object relations after 10 min, only when temporal synchrony between vocalizations and moving objects was provided during learning. In Exp 2, 7-mo-olds were habituated to the same syllable�object pairs in the presence of temporal synchrony and tested for memory after 4 days. Once again, infants learned and showed emerging memory for the syllable�object relations 4 days after original learning under the temporally synchronous condition. These findings are consistent with the view that prior to symbolic development, infants learn and remember word�object relations by perceiving redundant information in the vocal and gestural communication of adults.

Nine adult cochlear-implant users (aged 28�77 yrs) engaged in spontaneous conversation with naive communication partners who did not know about their HIs. The interactions were videotaped, orthographically transcribed, and coded. Ss usually recognized when they did not understand a message and then used repair strategies. Most commonly, they asked 'what?' or 'huh?', or used a nonverbal body gesture. Communication partners' most common response to these nonspecific repair strategies was a verbatim repetition of the original message. A model of 3 conversational styles (interactive, passive, and aggressive) is described. Persons with HI might display a constellation of behaviors typical of 1 or more of these styles.

22445276;pi413;A comprehensive theory of representation for mathematics education;Vergnaud G;Journal Article;"Representation is a difficult concept. Behaviorists wanted to get rid of it; many researchers prefer other terms like 'conception' or 'reasoning' or even 'encoding'; and many cognitive science researchers have tried to avoid the problem by reducing thinking to production rules. The author discusses at least two reasons for considering representation as an important subject for scientific study. The first is that we all experience representation as a stream of internal images, gestures and words. The second is that the words and symbols we use to communicate do not refer directly to reality but to represented entities: objects, properties, relationships, processes, actions, and constructs, about which there is no automatic agreement between two persons. It is the purpose of this paper to analyse this problem, and to try to connect it with an original analysis of the role of action in representation. The issue is important for mathematics education and even for the epistemology of mathematics, as mathematical concepts have their first roots in the action on, and in the representation of, the physical and social world; even though there may be a great distance today between that pragmatical and empirical source, and the sophisticated concepts of contemporary mathematics.

A distinction was drawn between referential and conventional emblems. For each culture, 25 emblems were selected that had an unambiguous meaning within the culture in which they originated. The study investigated whether all gestures judged to be referential were present in the Netherlands in the opinion of a sample of Dutch Ss. Allowing for a margin of error in the classification of the gestures, this hypothesis could not be rejected. The specificity of meaning of conventional gestures was investigated for which none of the Ss in the 1st part of the study knew the correct meaning. Results indicate that codes can be entirely arbitrary, with no trace of a cross-culturally shared referential basis. Psychological universalism seems to give the best account of the findings.

Ss imitated both static facial postures and dynamic facial gestures. There was no disappearance of FCI in the 2�3 mo olds. A proposal was made about the social and psychological functions that early imitation (EI) served in Ss' encounters with people. Ss deployed imitation to enrich their understanding of persons and actions, and EI was used for communicative purposes. A theoretical bridge was formed between EI and the 'object concept.' One of the psychological functions that EI served was to identify people. Ss used the nonverbal behavior of people as an identifier of who they were and used imitation as a means of verifying this identity.

In a 10-minute session, Spencer completed between one and six exercises from the curriculum and typically responded between 20 and 60 times per 10 minutes. The number of responses Spencer expressed during any given exercise was a minimum of x3 the number of required responses in the original teaching script, because of the need to present Spencer with a full range of correct and incorrect models.

Hypotheses specifying the replacement of gestural functions by speech as verbal skills improve, developmental correspondences between the 2 communicative domains, and the independence of language acquisition from nonverbal developments were drawn from evolutionary, structuralist, and nativist viewpoints, respectively. Both formal and functional aspects of each communicative skill were measured. Results indicate that formal and functional aspects of verbal and gestural skills were largely unrelated, particularly in the gestural domain. No evidence that language replaced gesture for communication in ontogeny was obtained. Correspondences between gesture and language occurred only between functional aspects of each. Findings suggest the independence of developing language from gestural advances.

Marr are taken up; he published his theory of the origin of language in 1926 in the Proceedings of the Oriental Institute of the Soviet Republics. Marr studied the language of the less known tribes of the Caucasus, which is extremely primitive and is still in the process of early formation. Language originates in the primitive society when man first begins to modify his environment; in other words, when he begins to work. The primitive man looks upon work as magic because he does not expect the results in profound changes in the individual. The whole organism, including the vocal apparatus, participates in the primitive production. Collective effort is always accompanied by the three original arts�dance, music and vocal speech. Previous to this in the history of evolution man used gestures as form of social intercourse. Vocal speech must have begun with the Stone Age, when man began to make implements. Language development goes parallel with the increase of collective, human activities.

22445038;pi425;Did throwing stones shape hominid brain evolution?;Calvin W H ;Journal Article;Suggests that early hominid evolution may have involved an interaction between lateralization to left brain of rapid motor sequencing (e.g., right-handedness) and its selection via 1-handed throwing of stones at small prey. Since a more redundant sequencer should permit faster orchestration of muscles, faster (and hence longer range) throws could have selected for encephalization. Secondary uses of the enlarged sequencer may have included tool-sharpening and manual gestures. Because an oral�facial sequencing area just below motor strip forms the core of modern language cortex, there may have been a common origin of handedness and language in redundant sequencing circuits selected by throwing success.

22445117;pi426;The origin and development of language;Nagge J W;Book Chapter;Vocal language is the means whereby words become a method of expression of ideas and feelings. The origin of language in the history of mankind is shrouded in the distant haze of antiquity. The thinkers of ancient Greece sought to find an answer to the question of its genesis. There is little doubt that vocal and sign language gained much in complexity as the evolution of a more complicated nervous system proceeded in man. Doubtless language began as a very simple series of grunts and gestures which were helpful in arousing meanings through their connections with the nervous engrams or traces of previous events. A cry of pain meant danger, a laugh meant pleasure, certain bodily attitudes meant caution or 'be on the alert' to those who previously had observed them. These cries and bodily attitudes ideationally aroused certain previous experiences which had been contiguous with them in the past.

22445364;pi427;The Biological and Social Significance of the Expression of the Emotions;Nony C ;Journal Article;Speculative article starting with a classification of emotions on the basis of expression with emphasis on the secretions. The social and biological significance of these expressions are noted. It is argued that all this applies equally well to a theory of the origin of language. Language must be formed by the continuation of the evolution of the expression of the emotions from the biological to the social. The emotional mimicry empties itself more and more of its affective contents and becomes a mere symbol�the language of gestures. On the other hand, the emotional reactions specializing in cry, which itself became intelligent and more and more complicated, developed into spoken language. From Psych Bulletin 19:12:00910.

22445528;pi428;The social significance of language;"Krueger E T; Reckless Walter C ";Book Chapter;Social psychology is not immediately concerned with the origin of language, since this scientific interest clearly falls within the province of philology. Neither is it directly concerned with the physiology or anatomy of human speech. On the other hand, it does have a vital interest in the relation of language and gesture to human nature, imagination, reflection, self-consciousness, and especially in the way in which the child learns to talk and takes over a vocabulary and the meaning of words and gestures. But before passing to the main part of this discussion, it is important to note the difference between animal gestures and human language and the relation of language to culture. Man is clearly distinguishable from the animal by his symbolic form of communication. Whether or not the cries, songs, and emotional expressions of animals really constitute a language, in the sense just mentioned, is very doubtful. Language and gestures of human beings, on the other hand, involve the transfer of ideas, meanings, memories. Whether language antedated culture in man's pre-history is a question which must, in the circumstances, be settled theoretically. The important point for social psychology and sociology is the active relationship of language to culture. Some means of symbolic communication, it appears, is necessary for the development of human nature. Reflection seems to be a peculiarly human trait. Whether animals actually reflect on experience and their own behavior is, in the light of recent research in animal psychology, very doubtful. A symbolic form of communication, enabling individuals to have a frame of reference for their behavior, really opens the door for the development of self-consciousness, which seems to be a socially acquired trait of human beings. Animals share consciousness with man, but it is doubtful whether they share self-consciousness with the human race. The balance of the chapter examines infant speech, linguistics, and language acquisition, emphasizing the social contexts.

22445166;pi430;The patient, the mother, the therapist: An interactional triangle in the treatment of the autistic child;Jakab I;Journal Article;Discusses the psychotherapy process of an autistic child from 31/2-6 yr. old. Based on the developmental history, and the clinical observations during psychotherapy, an attempt is made to present the patterns of communication and interaction as they developed from the original mother-child interaction through the development and changes in the child-therapist communication patterns. These changes were paralleled by changes in the mother-child interaction and in the mother-therapist interaction. The early unpredictable system of mother-child communication consisted of a mixture of aggression and rejection appearing at random. Through the initiation of psychotherapy, this reverberating pathological interaction changed to an interactional triangle between child-therapist, mother-child, and mother-therapist. Presently the child uses meaningful nonverbal communication, but does not use vocalization to convey messages. The therapy is continuing. The term of 'jargon communication' is proposed to define the global expressive disorder in autism. The distorted language (or the lack of it) and other pathological motor manifestations, representing a nonverbal gestural jargon, lead to the 'jargon communication.' (38 ref.)

22445738;pi431;Language;Klineberg O;Book Chapter;"There are several theories of the origin of language, but they account for the particular sounds used rather than for the phenomenon of communication. The suggestion that the first language was a language of gestures conflicts with the fact that vocal expression occurs in animals below man. The experimental evidence for phonetic symbolism supports the theory that onomatopoeia may account for some of the actual sounds used in spoken language. More important is the demonstration of a relationship between language and thought; the forms of language determine certain modes of observation and interpretation. This may be seen not only in the animistic thinking of young children, but also in the complex speculations of philosophers. The content of a vocabulary reflects the interests of the corresponding culture, but does not justify any conclusions as to the intellectual capacity of a people.

22444926;pi432;Development of instincts--The expressive instinct;Kirkpatrick E A;Book Chapter;This instinct belongs with the resultant and miscellaneous group because it owes its origin to various other instincts. Expression is a means of frightening enemies, and communicating with friends regarding food and danger, consequently it has been developed in the attainment of individual, parental, and social ends. In the lowest animals, expression, so far as there is any, is accomplished by means of feelers or antennae (notably in the case of ants), but in higher animals the chief means used are sounds. Most mammals and birds have from two or three to a dozen different calls which are appropriately responded to by others of their species. In man, the expressive instinct reaches its highest development because of his social nature and the perfectness of his vocal organs, and also because of the complexity of the mental states to be expressed. Instinctive emotional expression and expressive gestures are so effective that savages, without a word of artificial language in common, can communicate more accurately than any of the lower animals.

22444964;pi433;Relation of tone and gesture to words;Romanes G J;Book Chapter;"We have already seen that spoken language differs from the language of tone and gesture in being, as a system of signs, more purely conventional. This means that for semiotic purposes articulation is a higher product of mental evolution than either gesticulation or intonation. It also means that as an instrument of such evolution articulate speech is more efficient. The latter point is an important one, so I shall proceed to deal with it at some length. As noticed in a previous chapter, our system of coinage, bank-notes, and bills of sale is a more convenient system of signifying value of labour or of property, than is the more primitive and less conventional system of actually exchanging the labour or bartering the property; and our system of arithmetic is similarly more convenient for the purpose of calculation than is the more natural system of counting on the fingers. But not only are these more conventional systems more convenient; they are likewise conducive to a higher development of business transactions on the one hand, and of calculation on the other. In the absence of such an improved system of signs, it would be impossible to conduct as many or such intricate transactions and calculations as we do conduct. Similarly with speech as distinguished from gesture. Words, like gestures, are signs of thoughts and feelings; but in being more conventional they are more pure as signs, and so admit of being wrought up into a much more convenient or efficient system, while at the same time they become more constructive in their influence upon ideation. The great superiority of words over gestures in both these respects may most easily be shown by the use of a few examples.

22445390;pi434;Some prelinguistic aspects of language development;Call J D;Journal Article;Discusses prelinguistic aspects of language development in relation to the evolution of language function. The newborn infant engages and terminates visual, kinesthetic, oral, and sound reciprocity with the mother, thus providing the infant with a significant measure of control over reciprocal exchanges. The social smile, modulations thereof, and the face itself become organizers of meaningful vocalization, a focal point around which phonemes emerge from the mutuality of the mother�infant relationship. The evolution and meaning of the pointing gesture as it relates to language functioning and stages of separation�individuation are discussed. It is suggested that the child's capacity to evaluate the context of utterances in relation to dynamically integrated facial�vocal configurations with familiar caretakers provides the basis for the development of semantics and syntax in later language functioning.

Some issues that are not clear in Wundt's work are discussed, e.g., word order in gestural sentences, iconicity and arbitrariness, and the origin of gestures from the expression of emotions.

22444893;pi438;The emotions and conduct;Jastrow J;Book Chapter;"The author begins this chapter with a discussion of the emotions as sources of human quality, noting organic conditioning and the variety of expression. Emotions like irritability, anger, indignation, and lament are all examined, as are their functional service, and their points of inlet, central diffusion, and outlet in primary situations. The author then describes emotion as a spur to meet urgent situations, as the zest of experience, and as motive to conduct. The relation of emotions and sensibilities is noted. The author then describes the motor aspect of emotions and emotional regulation, particularly in regard to sex and food situations--what he calls the luxurious sensibilities and esthetic emotion--before he analyzes the intellectual expansion. After examining the primary emotions, the author analyzes fear as a primitive emotion. The expression of emotion is described, including facial and related miens and expression as incipient response, and the attitudes, situations, direction, and stages of emotional expression. Illustrations from animal responses are provided to illuminate the author's point. From this starting point, the author discusses the complexity of human emotion, the refinement of emotion and of its expression, facial language and its principles, mien and gesture, and the varied sources of facial expression. Also described are specialized expressions, differentiation and transfer, and natural and acquired expression, such as manner and restraint. The author then discusses emotion and its object, the role of instinct, and the complication and interplay of the emotions, such as attention interest and curiosity. The flexibility and evolution of emotions are then examined, in both presentative and representative stages. The emotional movement from pain to grief is analyzed, as is the intellectualization of emotions. Special bearings of the principle of transfer are discussed, including transfer in expression, emotional congeniality in transfer, and the evidence of language; gregariousness and sociability are used as examples. The author concludes by reiterating that emotion is central in human quality, again describing its sources and persistence.

22445769;pi441;A cross-cultural study of the communication of extra-verbal meaning by gestures;"Graham J A; Argyle M";Journal Article;"Conducted a study with 24 English and 24 Italian male college students. One member of each 4-member same-culture group was randomly assigned to be the encoder, the others to act as decoders. Encoders were asked to communicate 2-dimensional shapes to decoders, with and without the use of hand gestures, for materials of high and low verbal codability. Decoders drew what they thought the shapes were, and these were rated by English and Italian judges, for similarity to the originals. Higher accuracy scores were obtained by both the English and the Italians, when gestures were allowed, for materials of both high and low codability; but the effect of using gestures was greater for materials of low codability. Improvement in performance when gestures were allowed was greater for materials of low codability. Improvement in performance when gestures were allowed was greater for the Italians than for the English for both levels of codability. An analysis of the recorded verbal utterances has shown that the detriment in communication accuracy with the elimination of gestures cannot be attributed to disruption of speech performance; rather, changes in speech content occur, indicating an increased reliance on verbal means of conveying spatial information. It is concluded, nevertheless, that gestures convey this kind of semantic information more accurately, and evidence is provided for the gestures of the Italians communicating this information more effectively than those of the English.

Predicative Roots, definite in sound, and expressive of general concepts; 2. Demonstrative Elements, likewise definite in sound, but not conceptual in meaning. Leaving the demonstrative elements as unexplained, except as possible remnants of an early gesture language in which objects are simply pointed at, but not conceived or described, we now turn to the most important of all questions, viz. How did Concepts arise, those very concepts which are expressed by our predicative roots? The question of the origin of concepts, or of the origin of true relation between the singular and the general, is the cardinal question of all philosophy. Feuerbach does not exaggerate when he writes, 'The question as to the relation of the species to the individual is the most important and at the same time the most difficult question of human knowledge and philosophy.' Let us also remember that in analyzing language we found that its constituent elements were predicative and demonstrative roots. This is a fact, not an hypothesis, and it shows us that all words, so far from being, as Berkeley supposed, the means of forming general ideas, presuppose their existence in the shape of roots.

22445140;pi451;Learning Theory and Language Learning: The Problem of 'Imitation';Mowrer O H;Book Chapter;"The phenomenon of mediation provides a bridge or tradition from relatively simple principles that govern animal behavior to the more elaborate 'intellectual' or 'symbolic' processes found in humans. Language and learning have a curiously interactive, or reciprocal, relationship: language is itself learned; but, once learned, it then importantly facilitates and guides further learning. These two aspects of the relationship seem to be sufficiently important and sufficiently different to warrant separate chapters, the present one being devoted to language learning and the following one to learning through language. The systematic analysis of language learning, we shall find, generates a surprisingly satisfactory conception of imitative behavior in general, and one that articulates easily and meaningfully with the concept of 'habit' as it emerges in revised two-factor learning theory. After describing the understanding and use of words, the author turns to word learning and other instances of habit formation. The 'Autism' theory of word learning is restated and extended, then applied clinically.

22445259;pi452;Le suicide: essai d'�tude psychanalytique;Courchet J L ;Journal Article;Apparently, suicide is a rapturous gesture, stemming from oral regression which results from genetic or constitutional weaknesses, and involves the loss of a love-object. The trend originates early, when oscillations of excitation-inhibition fail to become integrated during the process of language formation. Furthermore, in some cases, these excitable impulses substitute for language. Therefore, a linguistic attack appears promising. Moreover, during psychoanalysis, therapy is enhanced by the communion between the unconscious of patient and analyst. 4 case studies.

22445677;pi453;Novoe uchenie o yazyke i dialekticheskiy materializm;Deborin A M ;Journal Article;Marr's new theory of language and thinking is in complete agreement with dialectic materialism. Language developed from gestures. Sign language originated as a woman's language in matriarchal civilizations and depended on the role of the hand as a primitive tool. Language and thinking were one, but gradually the tool became cause and the product effect, so that language became a form of thinking and thinking the content of language. General and abstract ideas first occurred when sound-language developed and artificial tools were used. The polysemantic word gradually is split into two which express opposite ideas (in Armenian the same word is used for soul as for body). In the age of primitive communism the synthetic structure of language develops, and later, with the differentiation of labor and the beginning of occupational grouping, occur the development of sentences, changes of meaning, etc. Class distinction and technical division of labor occur simultaneously with inflection in language.

22445061;pi454;The social psychology of George Mead;Faris E ;Journal Article;"Mead considered that the data for solving the problems of social psychology are to be found in the conduct and experience of men rather than in the behavior of lower animals or in the facts of physiology. The ongoing social process was his starting point, and man was assumed to be a part of nature, entirely and without residue. In the analysis of conscious reflective action he found use for all the psychological concepts. The social nature of man was assumed, and the self is shown to have its origin in communication, which leads in man to self-stimulation and self-response and the taking of the role of the other. Personality is a role in a social situation. Every self is in a social context. Auditory gestures are of first importance in self-stimulation; and when one becomes his own object, he achieves selfhood. The conception of the self is therefore dependent on the defining responses of others, which responses are abstracted into a 'generalized other.' Significant symbols, used with a consciousness of their meaning, occur only in man. Besides numerous original concepts which Mead proposed, he also gave new definition to many already familiar notions, such as imagination, perception, and attention, by relating them to action, either as phases of the act or as determined by it. In his doctrine of 'the I and the me,' he found for himself an escape from a mechanistic view of human nature and a fresh defense of responsibility and freedom.

22445111;pi456;Origins and basic principles of Wundt's V�lkerpsychologie;Danziger K;Journal Article;The origins of Wundt's conceptions are traced to some early notions of J. G. Herder and, more immediately, to the project of a V�lkerpsychologie developed by M. Lazarus and H. Steinthal (1860). Wundt criticized the Herbartian basis of the latter and proceeded to work out an alternative conception of psychology in its social aspects. The basis of this conception is provided by his analysis of human action and the theory of gestural communication to which this led. Cultural products are seen as presupposing a collective subject and as acting back on the psychology of the individual. It is suggested that although Wundt's conceptions have serious limitations, some aspects of his thought about the relationship of individual and culture provide perspectives that are of continuing interest.

The primitive scream, as a part of gestural language, already held a social function at the dawn of human society. This diffuse, inarticulate scream became divided later into tones, the oral and nasal being evolved first, then tongue and teeth sounds, etc. The whole diversity of the phenomena of the history of speech may be traced back to four original fundamental elements (sal, ber, yon, rosh) which naturally have been augmented by their intermixture. Semantics is based from the beginning on the process of speech construction.

This social dependence is exemplified in innumerable ways by the daily intercourse of men. Communication through speech and gesture, every kind of human congregation, imitative performances, the works of art, the organization of the state, and all acts or attitudes of persuasion, acquiescence, and command reveal the social origin or the social tempering of mental function. It is plain that this fundamental dependence of mind upon mind bears many aspects; and it is to the diversity of these aspects that we may confidently look for the explanation of the variety and multiplicity of tasks and problems which social psychology has undertaken.

22445770;pi460;Sympathetic imitation;Upham T C;Book Chapter;"We endeavoured, in its proper place, to illustrate the natural origin and the prevalence of the propensity to imitation. In connexion with the general truth of the existence of such a propensity, it is proper to observe here that there is a subordinate and peculiar form of imitation, which is deserving of a separate notice, and particularly so on account of its practical results. We speak now of what has been appropriately termed Sympathetic Imitation. It is implied, in all cases of Sympathetic Imitation, that there is more than one person concerned in them; and it exists, in general, in the highest degree, when the number of persons is considerable. Some one or more of these individuals is strongly agitated by some internal emotion, desire, or passion; and this inward agitation is expressed by the countenance, gestures, or other external signs. There is also a communication of such agitation of the mind to others; they experience similar emotions, desires, and passions. And these new exercises of soul are expressed on the part of the sympathetic person by similar outward signs. In a single word, when we are under the influence of this form of imitation, we both act and feel as others. And this happens, not only in consequence of what we witness in them, and apparently for no other reason, but it happens naturally; that is to say, in virtue of an implanted or natural principle. The view which we are inclined to take of this principle is, that, although we may properly speak of it, on account of its close resemblance, as a modification of the more ordinary form of Imitativeness, yet, on the whole, it is so far distinct and specific in its character as to entitle it to be regarded as a separate part of our sensitive nature. The sections of this chapter address the following topics: Familiar instances of sympathetic imitation; Instances of sympathetic imitation at the poor-house of Haerlem; and Other instances of this species of imitation.

22445464;pi463;The origin of language;Paget R A S ;Journal Article;A gesture theory is proposed to account for the fact (1) that many simple sounds bear closely related meanings in nearly all languages and (2) when a single sound is found to bear many different meanings (in the same language), these various meanings are found, in many instances, to be related. 'Thus, the sound (or word) ku is the result of a sudden release of a tongue-to-throat closure, formed far back in the mouth, and a projection of the rounded lips�so as to form an elongated tube through which the voice flows. According to the gesture theory, this mouth gesture would be related to an originating hand-gesture from which the mouth-gesture was derived by unconscious sympathy of movement between man's hands and his mouth.' In archaic Chinese 37 words and in Bohemian 51 words beginning with the ku sound were studied. This comparison and other evidence tend to support the hypothesis.

22445256;wos001;Voice, gesture and working memory in the emergence of speech;Aboitiz F;Journal Article;Language and speech depend on a relatively well defined neural circuitry, located predominantly in the left hemisphere. In this article, I discuss the origin of the speech circuit in early humans, as an expansion of an auditory-vocal articulatory network that took place after the last common ancestor with the chimpanzee. I will attempt to converge this perspective with aspects of the Mirror System Hypothesis, particularly those related to the emergence of a meaningful grammar in human communication. Basically, the strengthening of auditory-vocal connectivity via the arcuate fasciculus and related tracts generated an expansion of working memory capacity for vocalizations, that was key for learning complex utterances. This process was concomitant with the development of a robust interface with visual working memory, both in the dorsal and ventral streams of auditory and visual processing. This enabled the bidirectional translation of sequential codes into hierarchical visual representations, through the development of a multimodal interface between both systems.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445683;wos002;The Phonological Loop: A Key Innovation in Human Evolution;"Aboitiz F; Aboitiz S; Garcia R R";Journal Article;The phonological loop-here referred to as a specialized auditory-vocal sensorimotor circuit connecting posterior temporal areas with the inferior parietal lobe (Brodmann's areas 40 and 39) and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (Broca's region, Brodmann's areas 44 and 45)-is proposed to have been a fundamental element associated with the origin of vocal language in human evolution. This circuit derives from auditory prefrontal networks that preexist in the nonhuman primate but that acquired an unprecedented development in the human brain. The phonological loop overlaps and possibly coevolved with a more ancient circuit involved in hand manipulation and gesture coding ( the parieto-frontal mirror neuron network) and is complementary to a 'ventral' auditory circuit connecting the anterior temporal region with anterior Broca's area (area 45) via the extreme capsule. The development of the phonological loop produced a significant increase in short-term memory capacity for voluntary vocalizations, which facilitated learning of complex utterances that allowed the establishment of stronger social bonds and facilitated the communication of increasingly complex messages, eventually entailing external meaning and generating a syntactically ordered language. Furthermore, this circuit served as a template for the generation of more elaborate networks supporting these new modes of communication. Finally, the increase in short-term memory capacities associated with the elaboration of such networks facilitated the generation and processing of recursive linguistic structures based on long-distance dependencies between linguistic elements and on syntactic movement of phrase constituents. Thus, the acquisition of a functional phonological circuit can be considered as a key innovation that made possible a series of subsequent changes in human evolution leading to the complex and recursion-based language of modern humans.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445375;wos003;Philology of the Creolization of Mashriq's Musical TraditionsPhilology of the Creolization of Mashriq's Musical Traditions;Abou M N;Journal Article;"As expected from the colorful history of Mashriq's cultural geography and the symbolic system of the 'musical East,' there is today in that region a great variety of musical traditions. The richness of this region's music, regarding rhythm and style especially, is the natural result of these musical traditions' contextual differences. The fundamental distinction is the prosodic stamp that the language of the lyrics left on the rhythm of the chant, contextually depending on the language (Syrian, Greek, Persian, Coptic, Arabic, Turkish, Armenian, etc.) or dialect. It is mainly caused by the metrical influence (metrical stamp) of religious and non-religious rituals on the rhythm. This influence, which also appears in the logos (utterance/word) - melos (melody) dialectic and the vocal - instrumental music opposition of Ancient Greece, is inherent to the rituals' aesthetic preference between utterance and gesture. The threefold stylistic and aesthetical music modeling that has been chosen at the outset of the study and thoroughly explored within modal semiotics is based on the symbolic analysis of rituals involving music making. Based on a threefold semiotic approach, it is mainly inspired by the anthropology of religion. Thus have been studied the four principal, constituent and syncretist stages of the great musical traditions of the region: The foundation of the Christian hymnography (4th century); the beginnings of Medieval Arabic court music (7th century); inconsistencies in the traditional Eastern melodic systems (mainly 19th century) as a consequence of the contact with the West, and finally, the embodiment of a new form of theory-based Arabic music tradition ( artistic or classic) in Mashriq (19th century). All these stages have been explored, from the double perspective of semiotics and philology, as the evolution of the dialects of a single regional music idiom (trans-modal and transtraditional) that has undergone musical creolization.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Three same-gendered rock groups and two mixed-gendered rock groups were observed. Would students of different genders rehearse and compose differently? How would same-gendered processes compare to mixed-gendered processes? Research suggests that girls learn differently from boys and that gender as distinct from sex is formed in social environments. In research on popular music education, however, the participation of girls has been under-documented and under-theorized. This study found that boys and girls rehearsed and composed differently: Whereas the boys combined musical gestures and nonverbal communication into a seamless sonic process, the girls separated talk and musical production. In the mixed-gendered groups, tensions arose because participants used different learning styles that members of the opposite gender misunderstood.

22444937;wos005;The role of pantomime in gestural language evolution, its cognitive bases and an alternative;Abramova E;Journal Article;This article examines a popular trend of postulating that gestures have played a crucial role in the emergence of human language. Language evolution is frequently understood as a transition from a system, in which signals (whether vocal or manual) have fixed meanings and are used asymmetrically by senders and receivers, through specific cognitive and neurological changes, to a system, in which signals are (1) flexibly referential, i.e., can stand for a variety of ideas and (2) intersubjective, i.e., can be used equally in production and comprehension with any member of the community. The function assigned to gestures in gesture-first theories is to provide a first version of the more advanced open-ended communication in the form of spontaneous pantomimes that initiates a subsequent expansion of this system, its conventionalization and eventually a switch to the vocal modality. In the present article, I examine a particular theory that claims that pantomime was enabled by changes within the system of complex action recognition, and imitation. I argue that while the theory is promising, the notion of a pantomime it employs, presupposes two sophisticated abilities that themselves are left unexplained: symbolization and intentional communication. I point out two ways to remedy the situation, namely, constructing a leaner understanding of pantomime or supplementing the theory with an explanation for the emergence of these abilities. In this article I pursue a third option: identifying an alternative mechanism that can lead to a suitably complex language precursor while avoiding pantomime and its problematic cognitive bases altogether. This mechanism is ontogenetic ritualization, a well-known process responsible for the development of gestures in non-human primates. I outline the possibility that when placed in appropriate sociocultural circumstances, in which complementary actions around objects are required, this process can lead to signals that are modestly referential and intersubjective.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A qualitative textual analysis of 119 meme instances identified three dimensions of artwork that can be echoed in digital memes: the content, the form, and the artist. Consistent with the metaphor of communication as transmission, the mimesis of content uses artwork as a device for political expression. The mimesis of form and of the artist, on the other hand, provoke a response that emphasizes the aesthetics over the narrative, albeit for contrasting goals: while the former conveys a communal partaking of iconic gestures, which highlights what Carey depicted as the ritual view of communication, the latter distinguishes the imitators as individuals, thus comparing them to the original creator. This article demonstrates the memetic manipulation of fine art as a dual agent of individual and communal expression.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445400;wos007;Production and comprehension show divergent constituent order preferences: Evidence from elicited pantomime;"Hall M L; Ahn Y D; Mayberry R I; Ferreira V S";Journal Article;All natural languages develop devices to communicate who did what to whom. Elicited pantomime provides one model for studying this process, by providing a window into how humans (hearing non-signers) behave in a natural communicative modality (silent gesture) without established conventions from a grammar. Most studies in this paradigm focus on production, although they sometimes make assumptions about how comprehenders would likely behave. Here, we directly assess how naive speakers of English (Experiments 1 & 2). Korean (Experiment 1), and Turkish (Experiment 2) comprehend pantomimed descriptions of transitive events, which are either semantically reversible (Experiments 1 & 2) or not (Experiment 2). Contrary to previous assumptions, we find no evidence that PERSON-PERSON-ACTION sequences are ambiguous to comprehenders, who simply adopt an agent-first parsing heuristic for all constituent orders. We do find that PERSON-ACTION-PERSON sequences yield the most consistent interpretations, even in native speakers of SOV languages. The full range of behavior in both production and comprehension provides counter-evidence to the notion that producers' utterances are motivated by the needs of comprehenders. Instead, we argue that production and comprehension are subject to different sets of cognitive pressures, and that the dynamic interaction between these competing pressures can help explain synchronic and diachronic constituent order phenomena in natural human languages, both signed and spoken.

We claim that, although research efforts broadened perspectives that considered metaphors to be ornaments of poetic language, certain predominance of a linguistic point of view within investigations led to relatively little attention paid to (i) non-verbal and non-written metaphorical instantiations, and (ii) the pre-linguistic and cultural origins of metaphorical thought. Next, we attempt to delve into, and model, the ontogenetic origins of metaphor, taking into consideration social and cultural elements. To that end, we consider the Vygotskian perspective and contemporary research from the pragmatics of the object. We propose that metaphorical thought is an emerging result of a complex web of dynamic relationships between pre-linguistic and socioculturally regulated semiotic systems. The analysis undertaken shows the need for a research programme with a developmental orientation that considers metaphor to be a product of the intertwining between the individual and social dimensions of cognitive development. We suggest this programme should find its roots in the analysis of the semiotic skills that precede the acquisition of metaphorical language.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The accuracy results of three individual classifiers: (1) the support vector machine (SVM), (2) random forest (RF), and (3) nearest neighbour (kNN), using the original gestured dataset were compared with the accuracy results using an ensemble of the results of each classifier, as recommended by the literature. SVM produced higher overall accuracy when running as an individual classifier regardless of the number of observations for each letter. However, for letters with fewer than 65 observations each, which created a far smaller dataset, RF had higher accuracy than SVM did when using the ensemble approach. Although RF produced higher accuracy results for classes with limited class observation data, the difference between the accuracy results of RF in phase 2 and SVM in phase 1 was negligible. The researchers conclude that such a difference does not warrant using the ensemble approach for this experiment, which adds more processing complexity without a significant increase in accuracy.;Excluded;NA;Non-spontaneous communication;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There is a need for an interpretation system which could act as a bridge between them and those who do not know their sign language. A functional unobtrusive Indian sign language recognition system was implemented and tested on real world data. A vocabulary of 140 symbols was collected using 18 subjects, totalling 5041 images. The vocabulary consisted mostly of two-handed signs which were drawn from a wide repertoire of words of technical and daily-use origins. The system was implemented using Microsoft Kinect which enables surrounding light conditions and object colour to have negligible effect on the efficiency of the system. The system proposes a method for a novel, low-cost and easy-to-use application, for Indian Sign Language recognition, using the Microsoft Kinect camera. In the fingerspelling category of our dataset, we achieved above 90% recognition rates for 13 signs and 100% recognition for 3 signs with overall 16 distinct alphabets (A, B, D, E, F, G, H, K, P, R, T, U, W, X, Y, Z) recognised with an average accuracy rate of 90.68%.;Excluded;NA;Non-spontaneous communication;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We argue that motivated signs play an important role (i.e., signs that are linked to meaning by structural resemblance or by natural association). An experimental study is then reported in which participants try to communicate a range of pre-specified items to a partner using repeated non-linguistic vocalization, repeated gesture, or repeated non-linguistic vocalization plus gesture (but without using their existing language system). Gesture proved more effective (measured by communication success) and more efficient (measured by the time taken to communicate) than non-linguistic vocalization across a range of item categories (emotion, object, and action). Combining gesture and vocalization did not improve performance beyond gesture alone. We experimentally demonstrate that gesture is a more effective means of bootstrapping a human communication system. We argue that gesture outperforms non-linguistic vocalization because it lends itself more naturally to the production of motivated signs.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Conference on Cajal and ConsciousnessPurpose - We propose cloud IoT based LMS (Livestock Management System) with three features. i) Animal healthcare monitoring and recording using IoT sensors via wearable collar, ii) Animal livestock identification using UID for animals (smart tag) and owners (smart card), iii) QR code reading, processing and display of the details in mobile via wireless technologies.
Design/methodology/approach - The developed animal monitoring device is used to detect animal physiological parameters such as body temperature; physical gestures like sitting, standing, eating and heartbeat, environmental parameters such as air temperature and relative humidity. Also, e-animal husbandry information network management system is the comprehensive web-based animal husbandry software designed for better interaction between veterinary hospital, veterinary doctor, owner, farmer and animal husbandry management.
Findings - Animal monitoring device mounted on the neck sense the values and predict the health status of the animal by using cloud IoT analytics platform. The accuracy of the system is 90 per cent and it can be well placed in the livestock environment.
Research limitations/implications - This research is carried out in livestock cows located in Tirunelveli district. The practical difficulty was in placing sensors on the animal. The digital feed from the farmers and the veterinary hospital is input in the animal husbandry management software.
Practical implications - The developed system can be implemented for monitoring the health status of the animal from anywhere using mobile applications. Also, the digitized animal information helps the government to take the right decisions on policies and fund allocation.
Social implications - The implemented system can be easily scaled up to large environments by using wireless communication and animal husbandry data will be available immediately. UID scheme for animals can uniquely identify the animal and its details.

22445773;wos018;From Mirror Neurons to Complex Imitation in the Evolution of Language and Tool Use;Arbib M A;Journal Article;The mirror system hypothesis suggests that evolution expanded a basic mirror system for grasping, in concert with other brain regions first to support simple imitation (shared with the common ancestor of humans and great apes) and thence to complex imitation (unique to the hominin line), which includes overimitation, the apparent drawbacks of which are in fact essential to human skill transmission. These advances in praxis supported the emergence of pantomime and thence protosign and protospeech. This capacity, we claim, was adequate for cultural evolution to then yield language. We argue that Oldowan tool making corresponds to simple imitation and ape gestural communication and Acheulean tool making corresponds to complex imitation and protolanguage, whereas the explosion of innovations in tool making and social organization of the past 100,000 years correlates with the emergence of language.

22445236;wos019;Toward the Language-Ready Brain: Biological Evolution and Primate Comparisons;Arbib M A;Journal Article;The approach to language evolution suggested here focuses on three questions: How did the human brain evolve so that humans can develop, use, and acquire languages? How can the evolutionary quest be informed by studying brain, behavior, and social interaction in monkeys, apes, and humans? How can computational modeling advance these studies? I hypothesize that the brain is language ready in that the earliest humans had protolanguages but not languages (i.e., communication systems endowed with rich and open-ended lexicons and grammars supporting a compositional semantics), and that it took cultural evolution to yield societies (a cultural constructed niche) in which language-ready brains could become language-using brains. The mirror system hypothesis is a well-developed example of this approach, but I offer it here not as a closed theory but as an evolving framework for the development and analysis of conflicting subhypotheses in the hope of their eventual integration. I also stress that computational modeling helps us understand the evolving role of mirror neurons, not in and of themselves, but only in their interaction with systems 'beyond the mirror.' Because a theory of evolution needs a clear characterization of what it is that evolved, I also outline ideas for research in neurolinguistics to complement studies of the evolution of the language-ready brain. A clear challenge is to go beyond models of speech comprehension to include sign language and models of production, and to link language to visuomotor interaction with the physical and social world.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445777;wos020;Artful praxis: experience, inquiry and consciousness;Arnold J;Journal Article;"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to illuminate the way in which pre-service teachers adopt ways of thinking critically about learning and practice. It highlights the unfolding of critical dialogue, knowledge and artful action as a way of 'reading the scene' (Pahl and McKenna, 2015). The focus concerns mindshifts that occur while learning to be a teacher. The study sets out to seek factors that contribute towards development as professional practitioner. 
Design/methodology/approach As part of a much larger study involving ten pre-service teachers, this paper focusses on just one participant named Meredith, a pre-service teacher in her fourth year of her teacher education course. The design constructed draws on the data from Meredith's interview and conversation, art making and gestural activity while painting and communicating her stories. These narratives from interviews exist in this paper as vignettes and privilege of the interplay of art making, interview and gestural responses. Implementing a framework by Denzin (2001) enables a way of reading to note learning and epiphanic moments that exist for Meredith. 
Findings Moment of learning and themes are indicated and suggest that from the original interview there are 11 important moments of epiphanic mindshifts for Meredith. 
Originality/value The method as practice intends to make cogent links to new levels of consciousness by presenting innovative ways in which qualitative research data can be gathered and analysed.

Currently popular in the social and cognitive sciences, NP theory holds that much adaptive human behavior is too complex and nontransparent to learn via observation, imitation, and trial-and-error alone: Something extra is needed. NP employs humans' remarkable 'hyperprosocial' capacities/tools for interaction (e.g., gesture, gaze, facial expression, body movement, language) to effect teaching-based learning. NP's appearance in the hominin lineage likely predated humans; it is probably therefore the original form of teaching-based learning. A much more recent invention-the classroom-is often portrayed as separated from the rest of the world in order to enable teaching-based learning. Yet the interactional tools of NP occur pervasively in classrooms as well, making classrooms in this sense substantially continuous with the rest of the world. In both cases, according to the argument developed here, our evolved communicative toolkit underlies teaching-based learning.

One of the most straightforward examples of such constructions includes deictics, among them the German manner adverbial so ('like this') (cf.

While this multimodal construction is uncontroversial, this paper tests (and refutes) the broader claim that German so is regularly accompanied by gestures (Streeck 2002: 582, Grammars, words, and embodied meanings. On the evolution and uses of so and like. Journal of Communication 52(3). 581-596).

We explore two explanations that have been provided for multimodality: (i) selection for high information transfer through dedicated channels and (ii) increasing fault tolerance or robustness through multichannel signals. Robustness relates to an accurate decoding of a signal when parts of a signal are occluded. We show analytically in simple feed-forward neural networks that while a multichannel signal can solve the robustness problem, a multimodal signal does so more effectively because it can maximize the contribution made by each channel while minimizing the effects of exclusion. Multimodality refers to sets of channels where within each set information is highly correlated. We show that the robustness property ensures correlations among channels producing complex, associative networks as a by-product. We refer to this as the principle of robust overdesign. We discuss the biological implications of this for the evolution of combinatorial signalling systems; in particular, how robustness promotes enough redundancy to allow for a subsequent specialization of redundant components into novel signals.";Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Sculpting the Air-the first piece of this cycle-is conceived as a concerto for conductor with live electronics. The composer's work addresses the issue of the frequent lack of relationship between musicians and real-time electronic processing. In this piece, he employs two motion sensors, allowing the conductor to trigger sound files or to process instrumental sounds gesturally. We attended almost every work session during the production of the piece at Institute for Research and Communication in Acoustics/Music, and therefore collected a substantial amount of ethnographic data, in order to focus both on the creative process of the piece and the musical practice of the conductor in such a technological environment.

Recent evidence indicates that interpersonal understanding-in particular, skill at inferring others intentions-plays a piv-total role in this achievement. Infants as young as 12 to 18 months actively utilize clues to others intentions to guide their interpretation of language, emotion, and action more generally. In the language domain, for example, on hearing a new word, infants spontaneously check the speaker for intentional clues such as gaze direction, emotional expression, gestures, and body posture, and interpret the word in light of such information. By capitalizing on information about intentions, infants are able to avoid a wide range of potential errors, and to quickly learn relevant new skills. Current research is exploring the origins and developmental course of such early-emerging interpersonal skill, ultimately with an eye to understanding how disruptions in such abilities affect children's cognitive and social development.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Adopting a global approach should enhance our understanding of the mechanistic drivers of human brain functional lateralisation and help to explore further the nature of the left-hemispheric systems for both functions. This study investigated human laterality for both functions by taking, for the first time, numerous behaviours and multiple potential influential factors into consideration. We analysed replies to the Rennes Laterality Questionnaire that takes into account simultaneously: participants' behavioural, demographic and social characteristics as well as their genetic/social learning components and collateral factors such as health problems. We collected and analysed a large data set including 450,220 item responses (317,594 items related to behavioural laterality and 132,626 items related to personal information) by 5904 participants. The majority of participants were right-lateralised for nine behavioural categories. The laterality of right-lateralised individuals for the behaviours considered varied very little between behavioural categories, contrary to the laterality of ambiguously- and left-lateralised individuals. This is the first evidence of the stability of right-lateralised individuals and the relative flexibility of ambiguously- and left-lateralised individuals with regards to behavioural laterality related to 60 everyday activities. Moreover, the laterality patterns of our study population were linked in particular to the following individual-related factors: demographic characteristics (current continent of residence), social characteristics (socio-professional group and study level), and collateral factors (writing hand, forced right-hand use, guiding eye, and health problems related to ear and back).

22445398;wos032;Dyadic interactions, attachment and the presence of triadic interactions in chimpanzees and humans;Bard K A;Journal Article;From a developmental perspective, dyadic interactions with social partners and dyadic interactions with objects underpin early social cognition in humans and chimpanzees. In humans, dyadic social relationships form in the first three months of life, dyadic relations with objects form in the first 6 months of life, and triadic relations begin around 8-12 months. In chimpanzees, a similar developmental pattern is evident with dyadic social relationships forming in the first three months of life, dyadic relations with objects forming in the first 5 months of life, and triadic relations in the latter half of the first year of life. During ontogeny humans and chimpanzees experience emotional engagements, both with social partners and with objects, and these impact outcomes in social cognition. Rather than being considered too complex, diversity of socio-emotional experiences during development can be embraced, with the goal to specify how they influence social cognition outcomes in humans and in chimpanzees. This process may provide the evolutionary and biological foundations for plasticity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

On the Move Confederated International Workshop and Conference
This paper introduces ThreadMill � a distributed and parallel component architecture for applications that process large volumes of streamed (time-sequenced) data, such as is the case e.g. in speech and gesture recognition applications.
Many stream-oriented applications offer ample opportunity for enhanced performance via concurrent execution, exploring a wide variety of parallel paradigms, such as task, data and pipeline parallelism. ThreadMill addresses the challenges of development and evolution of parallel and distributed applications in this domain by offering a modeling formalism, a programming framework and a runtime infrastructure. Component development and reuse, and application evolution are facilitated by the isolation of communication, concurrency, and synchronization concerns promoted by ThreadMill. A direct consequence of the novel mechanisms introduced by ThreadMill is that applications composed of reusable components can be re-targeted, unchanged, and made to run efficiently on a variety of execution environments. These environments can range e.g. from a single machine with a single processor, to a cluster of heterogeneous computational nodes, to certain classes of supercomputers. Experimental results show an eight-fold speedup when using ten nodes of an AlphaServer DS20 cluster running a proof-of-concept 2D video-based tracker for hands and face of American Sign Language signers.";Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the present study we investigated whether, in the context of a communicative interaction between two agents, observers can use the actions of one agent to predict when the action of a second agent will take place. Participants observed point-light displays of two agents (A and B) performing separate actions. In the communicative condition, the action performed by agent B responded to a communicative gesture performed by agent A. In the individual condition, agent A's communicative action was substituted with a non-communicative action. For each condition, we manipulated the temporal coupling of the actions of the two agents, by varying the onset of agent A's action. Using a simultaneous masking detection task, we demonstrated that the timing manipulation had a critical effect on the communicative condition, with the visual discrimination of agent B increasing linearly while approaching the original interaction timing. No effect of the timing manipulation was found for the individual condition. Our finding complements and extends previous evidence for interpersonal predictive coding, suggesting that the communicative gestures of one agent can serve not only to predict what the second agent will do, but also when his/her action will take place.;Included;Excluded;Not about language evolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

22445779;wos038;Intentional icons - towards an evolutionary cognitive ethology;"Bekoff M; Allen C";Journal Article;In most species in which social play has been observed, play-soliciting signals have evolved. These social signals appear to be important in communicating play intention. Here, using the work of Ruth MILLIKAN as a working guide and canid play bows as an example, we argue that (i) some play signals may be simple 'intentional icons' and (ii) senders and receivers are 'cooperating devices,' in that the disposition of senders to produce play-soliciting signals and the disposition of receivers of play signals to respond appropriately to play invitations, have evolved together. MILLIKAN's views of social communication are difficult to render and are virtually untested. However, her stance, while philosophically controversial, is somewhat consistent with early ethological views of social communication. Thus, in combination with classical ethological positions, MILLIKAN's position could serve as a useful guide not only to inform and motivate future empirical research in cognitive ethology, but also to stimulate ethologists to reconsider, in innovative ways, nonhuman animal cognition. To reject the empirical utility of MILLIKAN'S theory because of its difficulty or on philosophical grounds would be premature and would represent a confusion of empirical with philosophical issues.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Furthermore, intentional object presentation has been suggested as an extremely rare form of communication evolutionarily. Research on comparable means of communication in non-human species may therefore shed light on the selection pressures that acted upon components of human communication. However, the functions and cognitive mechanisms that underlie object presentation in animals are poorly understood. Here, we addressed these issues by investigating object presentations in wild, cooperative breeding Arabian babblers (Aves: Turdoides squamiceps). Our results showed that individuals presented objects to specific recipients. The recipients most often responded by approaching the signaler and the dyad then moveed jointly to copulate at a hidden location. We provide evidence that object presentations by Arabian babblers (i) do not represent a costly signal, as objects were not costly to acquire; (ii) were not used to trade food for sex, as the presentation of food was not more likely to result in copulation; and (iii) possessed hallmarks of first-order intentionality.

This desire, however, forces us to recollect that all of Derrida's thinking disputes a 'simple' conception of the 'origin': that is, 'origin' construed in terms of an original presence found at some indivisible point (in other words, the metaphysical conception of 'origin'). This metaphysical construal is challenged by Derrida's insight that such a concept of 'origin' was only ever the product of instituted traces - or of what he himself calls 'writing'. And this insight concerning origins leads us toward what is perhaps most fundamental in Derrida's thought, namely a thinking about the founding gesture of institutions. Here, whether one is talking about the institution of language or of the university, it is the pre-legal violence of the founding act that leaves its mark, opening up a strange diremption within institutions between the desire to conserve and defend an established set-up, and an unavoidable exposure to what is unpredictable. Thus, the institution suffers an autoimmune disorder which leaves it caught undecidably between life and death - although in the case of L'Universite sans condition, this indelible scar of the institution's institution leads to the chance of affirmation, and ultimately to the possibility of life over, after or in death: in other words, survival.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444948;wos042;Learning interspecific communicative responses in Pampas foxes (Lycalopex gymnocercus);"Barrera G; Jakovcevic A; Mustaca A; Bentosela M";Journal Article;Domestic dogs show remarkable communicative abilities in their interaction with people. These skills maybe explained by the interaction between the domestication process and learning experiences during ontogeny. Studies carried out on other species of canids, which have not been domesticated are relevant to this topic. The purpose of this article is to study the effect of instrumental learning on captive Pampas foxes' (Lycalopex gymnocercus)communicative responses to humans. Seven foxes were tested in a conflict situation involving food within sight but out of their reach. In these situations dogs typically gaze at the human face to ask for food. In Study 1, there was an increase in gaze duration as a consequence of reinforcement and a decrease during extinction, when animals did not receive any more food. In Study 2, all of the four foxes tested successfully followed proximal pointing gesture to find hidden food. When a distal pointing cue was given, three out of four followed it in the first session and one in the second session. These results are consistent with those previously found in dogs, and suggest that learning experiences allow the development of communicative skills, even in not domesticated canid species.

22445766;wos043;Do gestures retain mental associations with their iconic origins, even after they become emblematic? An analysis of the middle-finger gesture among American English speakers;Bergen B K;Journal Article;What concepts and words do communicative gestures activate in the minds of people who view them? It's widely believed that many gestures grow from iconic origins-they look like what they mean-but also that at some point they may become emblematic-conventionalized as culturally agreed-upon symbols. How long do links between physical movements of the body and the things in the world they denote persist in the minds of gesture-users? A pair of experiments asks this question for the Middle-Finger, a cross-culturally recognized obscene gesture. The prevailing view is that the gesture originates in a phallic symbol. Yet it is now predominantly used as an emblematic gesture displaying contempt (among other things). It is currently unknown whether the iconic origins of gestures persist through the emblematic stage in the minds of gesture users. Two experiments tested the hypothesis that viewing the Middle-Finger primes thoughts about penises or the word penis. The results showed that the Middle-Finger induced no priming of penis compared with control, unlike another obscene penis-representing gesture (Finger-Bang), which did. This suggests that the Middle-Finger no longer activates thoughts of penises in the minds of contemporary American English speakers. Emblematic gestures with iconic origins may undergo historical change not just in the functions they serve but also in the effects they have on the minds of people who use them.;Included;Excluded;Non-spontaneous communication;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444832;wos044;Aesthetic Frisson: in Search of Theoretical Explanation;Beriachvili G;Journal Article;"Over the last three decades, an interdisciplinary corpus has emerged studying psychological, neurobiological and aesthetic aspects of aesthetic frisson (chills). The present paper confronts this corpus with author's original work. According to the latter, the human need for artistic activity is grounded on two fundamental mechanisms. The first one consists of conjuring up the experience of the close intersubjective union rooted in the unconscious, through the mimesis of the elements of human expressive communication. The second one, on the other hand, pertains to a merging with Nature in the broader sense, through the mimesis of the elements and forces of the outer universe. The aesthetic frisson would be related to the actualization of the primeval experience of union.
The closest to this view is Jaak Panksepp's theory (1995), according to which the effect of aesthetic frisson could be traced back to a reaction that can be observed in most mammals: piloerection as a response to the separation call issued by young animals when lost. Resting upon this premise, the paper suggests that in the evolution of art, a general collective union plays a more important role than private interindividual union, for the reason that the temporal arts descend from primitive collective ritual ceremonies.
The aesthetic frisson is considered as a powerful component of art's cathartic effect. The paper provides a theoretical frame to explain its capacity for emotional consolidation of social groups and psychological harmonization on individual and social levels.

22445331;wos048;Hand gestures as visual prosody: BOLD responses to audio-visual alignment are modulated by the communicative nature of the stimuli;"Biau E; Fernández L M; Holle H; Avila C; Soto-Faraco S";Journal Article;"During public addresses, speakers accompany their discourse with spontaneous hand gestures (beats) that are tightly synchronized with the prosodic contour of the discourse. It has been proposed that speech and beat gestures originate from a common underlying linguistic process whereby both speech prosody and beats serve to emphasize relevant information. We hypothesized that breaking the consistency between beats and prosody by temporal desynchronization, would modulate activity of brain areas sensitive to speech-gesture integration. To this aim, we measured BOLD responses as participants watched a natural discourse where the speaker used beat gestures.
In order to identify brain areas specifically involved in processing hand gestures with communicative intention, beat synchrony was evaluated against arbitrary visual cues bearing equivalent rhythmic and spatial properties as the gestures. Our results revealed that left MTG and IFG were specifically sensitive to speech synchronized with beats, compared to the arbitrary vision-speech pairing. Our results suggest that listeners confer beats a function of visual prosody, complementary to the prosodic structure of speech. We conclude that the emphasizing function of beat gestures in speech perception is instantiated through a specialized brain network sensitive to the communicative intent conveyed by a speaker with his/her hands.

22445480;wos049;What is the body and gestures of the characters who populate the Middle English Breton?;Blandeau A;Journal Article;The Middle English Breton Lays edited by Anne Laskaya and Eve Salisbury (1995) were written between the late 13th and the 15th century. They form a miscellaneous body of poems grafted onto a pre-existing literary form, the lai, best illustrated by Marie de France. Let us note in passing that the poet, whose name only appeared in the 16th century, claims that her sources originate in the duchy of Brittany, where actually no lay whatsoever was ever produced. In other words, it is a purely undocumented contention on Marie's part. England became the new scene of the continental genre. This organic form grew out of the lai tradition in a modified shape, in different array. The brevity of this type of mini-romance and the brisk pace of its narration are reflected in the very mobility of the animated bodies that are pictured crying, praying, repenting, serving, hunting, fighting, or dancing and revelling. The English lays provide precious clues about medieval life, whether actual or idealised. This article attempts to scrutinize the references to body language, gestures and even gesticulations, especially what connotations they take on depending on the context-from the royal court to fairyland, from the jousting lists to the town. Actions and postures in the poems under study betray heightened emotion, sometimes blinding passion, deep grief, irreparable distraction, or unrequited love. Whether keeping their self-control or yielding to irrepressible desires, the protagonists' bodies almost seem real. Yet a 21st-century reader is sure to be intrigued by the meanings of some physical attitudes, which invite interpretation in an approach both literary and anthropological. The gesture is the habit (us) of the voice, as the deeds and body movements are supposed to match the words.

To date, investigations of human laterality focused mainly on non-communication functions. Although gestural laterality data have been published for infants and children, relatively little is known about laterality of human gestural communication. This study investigated human laterality in depth considering non-communication manipulation actions and various gesture types involving hands, feet, face and ears. We constructed an online laterality questionnaire including 60 items related to daily activities. We collected 317 594 item responses by 5904 randomly selected participants. The highest percentages of strong left-lateralized (6.76%) and strong right-lateralized participants (75.19%) were for manipulation actions. The highest percentages of mixed left-lateralized (12.30%) and ambidextrous (50.23%) participants were found for head-related gestures. The highest percentage of mixed right-lateralized participants(55.33%) was found for auditory gestures. Every behavioural category showed a significant population-level right-side bias. More precisely, participants were predominantly right-lateralized for non-communication manual actions, for visual iconic, visual symbolic, visual deictic (with and without speech), tactile and auditory manual gestures as well as for podial and head-related gestures. Our findings support previous studies reporting that humans have left-brain predominance for gestures and complex motor activities such as tool-use. Our study shows that the Rennes Laterality Questionnaire is a useful research instrument to assess and analyse human laterality for both manipulation and communication functions.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445534;wos053;The baboon: A model for the study of language evolution;"Fagot J; Boe L J; Berthomier F; Claidiere N; Malassis R; Meguerditchian A; Rey A;   Montant M";Journal Article;Comparative research on the origins of human language often focuses on a limited number of language related cognitive functions or anatomical structures that are compared across species. The underlying assumption of this approach is that a single or a limited number of factors may crucially explain how language appeared in the human lineage. Another potentially fruitful approach is to consider human language as the result of a (unique) assemblage of multiple cognitive and anatomical components, some of which are present in other species. This paper is a first step in that direction. It focuses on the baboon, a non-human primate that has been studied extensively for years, including several brain, anatomical, cognitive and cultural dimensions that are involved in human language. This paper presents recent data collected on baboons regarding (1) a selection of domain-general cognitive functions that are core functions for language, (2) vocal production, (3) gestural production and cerebral lateralization, and (4) cumulative culture. In all these domains, it shows that the baboons share with humans many cognitive or brain mechanisms which are central for language. Because of the multidimensionality of the knowledge accumulated on the baboon, that species is an excellent nonhuman primate model for the study of the evolutionary origins of language.

22444877;wos054;Syntax in language and music: what is the right level of comparison?;"Asano R; Boeckx C";Journal Article;It is often claimed that music and language share a process of hierarchical structure building, a mental 'syntax.' Although several lines of research point to commonalities, and possibly a shared syntactic component, differences between 'language syntax' and 'music syntax' can also be found at several levels: conveyed meaning, and the atoms of combination, for example. To bring music and language closer to one another, some researchers have suggested a comparison between music and phonology ('phonological syntax'), but here too, one quickly arrives at a situation of intriguing similarities and obvious differences. In this paper, we suggest that a fruitful comparison between the two domains could benefit from taking the grammar of action into account. In particular, we suggest that what is called 'syntax' can be investigated in terms of goal of action, action planning, motor control, and sensory-motor integration. At this level of comparison, we suggest that some of the differences between language and music could be explained in terms of different goals reflected in the hierarchical structures of action planning: the hierarchical structures of music arise to achieve goals with a strong relation to the affective-gestural system encoding tension-relaxation patterns as well as socio-intentional system, whereas hierarchical structures in language are embedded in a conceptual system that gives rise to compositional meaning. Similarities between music and language are most clear in the way several hierarchical plans for executing action are processed in time and sequentially integrated to achieve various goals.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Several purely anatomical arguments have been put forward, but they have been shown to be false, biologically implausible, or of limited scope. This perspective paper supports the idea that evolutionary theories of speech could benefit from a focus on the cognitive mechanisms that make speech possible, for which antecedents in evolutionary history and brain correlates can be found. This type of approach is part of a very recent but rapidly growing trend that has already provided crucial insights on the nature of human speech by focusing on the biological bases of vocal learning. Here we contend that a general mechanism of attention, which manifests itself not only in the visual but also in the auditory modality, might be one of the key ingredients of human speech, in addition to the mechanisms underlying vocal learning, and the pairing of facial gestures with vocalic units.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445007;wos057;Imitation reconsidered: Its social function in early infancy;Bordoni M;Journal Article;"Infant imitation is a controversial topic that has been widely studied in the field of developmental psychology. In the last decades, since Piagetian theory of infant imitation, the research on it has been revolutionized. This article intends to review a set of studies on imitation in early infancy that have caused a change in the understanding of this phenomenon.
In this review, Piaget's description of the development of imitation and its relationship to symbolic formation are set as a starting point. Piaget's theory has made an essential contribution to the study of imitation: it highlights its importance in development of symbolic function; it stimulated the realization of numerous longitudinal studies, promoted the development of techniques and observation systems for its evaluation in psychology labs, and led to the generation of different assessment scales of psycho-motor child development. However, experimental studies that demonstrated the ability of imitation in newborns have questioned Piagetian developmental theory of imitation and they revolutionized the understanding of the phenomenon. Data on neonatal imitation, which have received different theoretical interpretations, bring out that certain intra and intersensory coordination exist from the first month of life; that the capacity for imitation is selective; that its sequence of development is different from that proposed by Piaget and shows different evolutionary paths depending on the act in question. Beyond experimental studies, early imitation has also been studied in natural contexts. The data show that during the first two years of life, imitation is a frequent pattern of social interaction between adult and baby, providing a pleasant experience to both participants. In that context, imitation is not only bi-directional, but it is the adult who imitated more frequently. Such data suggest that the ability to imitate actions does not appear in development as a product of an exclusively individual process; but, on the contrary, is a capacity that gradually emerges in the context of social patterns of baby-adult reciprocity as a result of the communicative intentions of the latter. Also, imitation is an important relationship tool when the participants interacting are similar in age. There arc several studies showing that young children use imitation as a basic way to interact and develop social and communication links between them, as well as to coordinate playful actions. Finally, experimental studies on the effects of being imitated indicate that adult imitation facilitates social interaction with the baby during the first two years of life. It causes greater visual attention from the baby, and more frequent smiles than a spontaneous interaction. Even it has been observed that babies are able to monitor adult imitation, testing it by modulating their behavior (for example, sudden stops or sudden changes in the direction of their behavior). Data from studies on neonatal imitation, spontaneous imitation in adult-baby interactions, peer interactions and the effects of being imitated have allowed reconceptualizing imitation, highlighting the social aspect and its role in the establishment of the first interpersonal connections between the baby and its congeners. All these new empirical evidence highlights the value of imitation in the establishment of social interactions in the early years of a child's life, beyond their cognitive function of accommodation. In order to construct an integrative theory of imitation, it is proposed to conceive imitation as a matching activity through which emerges a social engagement that might serve to convey different functions according to the context of social interaction. It is suggested to early out new longitudinal studies that investigate the contexts of interaction in which imitation events emerge, as well as the integration of the results of neurocognitive studies and Comparative Psychology.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Their use is an indicator of intentional communication and thus of great interest to researchers in the field of language evolution. However, there is conflicting evidence as to whether nonhuman primates use attention-getters, both in conspecific interactions and in interactions with humans. We examined whether zoo-housed orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus and hybrid [Pongo pygmaeus x Pongo abelii]) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) used auditory signals to initiate visual communication with a human. To test this, a human experimenter stood with food in her hand and her back to the ape. If the ape produced an auditory signal, the experimenter either turned to face the ape or, in the control condition, away from the ape. We found that condition had no significant effect on whether the apes followed their initial auditory signal with a visual signal. Furthermore, the apes did not show greater persistence with, or elaboration of, their auditory signals when the human did not turn to face them, than when she did. In contrast, the apes showed significantly more persistence and elaboration of visual signals when the experimenter turned to face them. Our results suggest that while the orangutans and gorillas were able to discriminate human visual attention and use visual gestures accordingly, they did not attempt to manipulate this attention through the use of auditory behaviors to initiate visual communication.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study investigates how individual learning experience affects subsequent ability to tailor gestural communication to audience visual attention. Olive baboons were atypically trained to request food with gestures by a human standing in profile, while not having access to her face. They were tested immediately after training, and then 1year later in conditions that varied the human's cues to attention. In immediate testing, these baboons (profile group baboons) gestured towards untrained cues regardless of their relevance for visual communication. They were also less discriminant towards trained versus untrained cues than baboons trained by a human facing them (face group baboons, tested in Bourjade et al.

In delayed testing, the number of gestures towards meaningful untrained cues increased and profile group baboons discriminated the orientation of the human body, a conspicuous proxy of visual attention.

22444830;wos062;Acquisition of joint attention by olive baboons gesturing toward humans;"Lamaury A; Cochet H; & Bourjade M";Journal Article;"Joint attention is a core ability of human social cognition which broadly refers to the coordination of attention with both the presence and activity of social partners. In both human and non-human primates, joint attention can be assessed from behaviour; gestures and gaze alternation between the partner and a distal object are standard behavioural manifestations of joint attention. Here we examined the acquisition of joint attention in olive baboons as a function of their individual experience of a human partner's attentional states during training regimes. Eleven olive baboons (Papio anubis) were observed during their training to perform food-requesting gestures, which occurred either by (1) a human facing them (face condition), or (2) by a human positioned in profile who never turned to them (profile condition). We found neither gestures nor gaze alternation were present at the start of the training but rather developed over the training period. Only baboons in the face condition showed an increase in the number of gaze alternations, and their gaze pattern progressively shifted to a coordinated sequence in which gazes and gestures were coordinated in time. In contrast, baboons trained by a human in profile showed significantly less coordination of gazes with gestures but still learned to request food with their gestures. These results suggest that the partner's social attention plays an important role in the acquisition of visual joint attention and, to a lesser extent, in gesture learning in baboons. Interspecific interactions appear to offer rich opportunities to manipulate and thus identify the social contexts in which socio-communicative skills develop.";Included;Excluded;Non-spontaneous communication;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It has been argued that an evolving compositional protolanguage would not be useful for communication until it reached a certain level of grammatical complexity. This paper offers a new, discourse-oriented perspective on the debate. It argues that discourse should be viewed, not as a level of language structure 'beyond the sentence, but as sequenced communicative behaviour, typically but not uniquely involving language. This provides for continuity from exchanges making use of simple communicative resources such as single words and gestures to those making use of complex grammatical conventions. Supporting evidence comes from child language and from original experiments with adults using constrained language systems.

22445450;wos067;The pleasures of imitation: Gabriel Tarde, Oscar Wilde, and Joao do Rio in brazil's long fin de siecle;Braga-Pinto C;Journal Article;This article, drawing on the insights of Sylvia Molloy in her studies of Spanish-American modernismo and the ambivalent reception of Oscar Wilde in Latin America, explores the postures and impostures of some of the most renowned translators and emulators of Wilde in Brazil, such as Elisio de Carvalho and, more importantly, Paulo Barreto (who wrote under the pseudonym Joao do Rio). Wilde served these writers, translators, and dandies as a model and provided a language to legitimize the gesture of cosmopolitan imitation at a moment when criminologists (like Cesare Lombroso) and sociologists (like Gabriel Tarde) devoted significant time and energy to the study of imitation in a context of increasing demand for authenticity, originality, and identity. I conclude that dissident and sometimes racialized bodies and sexualities strategically manipulated the exhibition of their own bodies and works, in stark contrast to the earlier psychopathologies of nineteenth-century criminologists and the various forms of nationalism that were being articulated at the turn of the century and would flourish with the avant-garde movements in the 1920s.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444976;wos068;Symbolic gestures and spoken language are processed by a common neural system;"Xu J; Gannon P J; Emmorey K; Smith J F; Braun A R";Journal Article;Symbolic gestures, such as pantomimes that signify actions (e. g., threading a needle) or emblems that facilitate social transactions (e. g., finger to lips indicating 'be quiet''), play an important role in human communication. They are autonomous, can fully take the place of words, and function as complete utterances in their own right. The relationship between these gestures and spoken language remains unclear. We used functional MRI to investigate whether these two forms of communication are processed by the same system in the human brain. Responses to symbolic gestures, to their spoken glosses (expressing the gestures' meaning in English), and to visually and acoustically matched control stimuli were compared in a randomized block design. General Linear Models (GLM) contrasts identified shared and unique activations and functional connectivity analyses delineated regional interactions associated with each condition. Results support a model in which bilateral modality-specific areas in superior and inferior temporal cortices extract salient features from vocal-auditory and gestural-visual stimuli respectively. However, both classes of stimuli activate a common, left-lateralized network of inferior frontal and posterior temporal regions in which symbolic gestures and spoken words may be mapped onto common, corresponding conceptual representations. We suggest that these anterior and posterior perisylvian areas, identified since the mid-19th century as the core of the brain's language system, are not in fact committed to language processing, but may function as a modality-independent semiotic system that plays a broader role in human communication, linking meaning with symbols whether these are words, gestures, images, sounds, or objects.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Recent work suggests that the SOV order may be the default in human language. Why, then, is SVO order so common? We hypothesize that SOV/SVO variation can be explained by language users' sensitivity to the possibility of noise corrupting the linguistic signal. In particular, the noisy-channel hypothesis predicts a shift from the default SOV order to SVO order for semantically reversible events, for which potential ambiguity arises in SOV order because two plausible agents appear on the same side of the verb. We found support for this prediction in three languages (English, Japanese, and Korean) by using a gesture-production task, which reflects word-order preferences largely independent of native language. Other patterns of crosslinguistic variation (e.g., the prevalence of case marking in SOV languages and its relative absence in SVO languages) also straightforwardly follow from the noisy-channel hypothesis.;Included;Excluded;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23080819;wos072;Amangama amathathu 'The three letters' The emergence of a quotable gesture (emblem);Brookes H;Journal Article;"This paper describes the emergence of a quotable gesture for HIV/AIDS in South Africa. The gesture has its origin in the Zulu phrase amangama amathathu 'the three letters', an expression South Africans began to use from the mid-1990s to refer to the acronym HIV. This phrase generated a plethora of words and phrases for HIV using the concept of 'three'. With these spoken references, speakers would sometimes use a manual expression for 'three' by showing three extended fingers. With repeated use, the manual expression by itself came to be established as a quotable gesture for HIV. The gesture became independent of speech as a noticeable increase in the number of deaths from HIV occurred. From observations of use in every day situations, speakers use the gesture primarily to mitigate the crude or indelicate effect of directly saying a person has HIV in speech. Use of the gesture also demonstrates sensitivity and empathy on the part of the speaker and lessens the speaker's commitment to, and consequently their responsibility for suggesting a person has the disease. Whether for secret communication or openly displayed for dramatic effect, speakers use this gesture in conjunction with speech in nuanced ways to avoid breaking the spoken taboo and flouting social norms. The emergence of this gesture suggests that speech taboos are a key reason for gestures becoming quotable; hence the large number of quotable gestures that represent socially awkward and potentially offensive words and speech acts. The adaptation of a counting gesture demonstrates that one source for new quotable gestures may be the re-semanticization of an existing gesture through spoken semantic links. In the case of the HIV gesture, spoken language played a key role in disseminating the metonym of 'three' and establishing a common ground for a quotable gesture to emerge across many communities in South Africa.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Implications for theories on the relationship between gesture and speech and processes of speech-gesture production are discussed. Data presented suggest that the Growth Point model of speech-gesture production has the most explanatory power, but it needs to extend the central notion of context to fully explain the nature of gestural behavior. Questions related to the emergence of quotable gestures in terms of origin, conventionalization, and detachability from speech, the relationship of quotable gestures to other forms of gesture, and the categorization of gestures into gestural typologies are also addressed.

It may be the most common symbolic subject in Romanesque art-hundreds of examples survive in the portal sculptures of southern French and northern Spanish churches-but the answers to fundamental questions about the chrismon's meaning and purpose in eleventh- and twelfth-century sculpture are disputed. A vast body of largely unconsidered evidence for the chrismon points overwhelmingly to a new answer for the old questions: the chrismon was the chief consecration mark in the doorway of the church. It was designed to receive lustration with the chrismal oils by which the bishop sanctified the entryway to the church in the liturgy of dedication, preserving in durable form the ephemeral marks, gestures, and language of the rite of consecration. This insight offers new perspective on the interactive reception of Romanesque sculpture and on the origin and purposes of the art of sculpture itself-both on its slow maturation and growth during the eleventh century out of ancient liturgical marks, including the chrismon and other signs over the threshold, and its abiding functional connection to liturgy.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the present functional MRI experiment, participants were asked to describe the spatial properties of objects (e.g. a motorcycle) using speech, pantomime, and drawing. Pairwise conjunction analyses revealed that the left inferior gyrus - in combination with the left basal ganglia and ventral anterior thalamus - was jointly activated for the production of speech and pantomime but not for the conjunctions with drawing. Drawing and pantomime instead showed strong overlap in the intraparietal sulcus and superior parietal region bilaterally.

22445223;wos076;Anatomical origin of déjà vu and vivid 'memories' in human temporal lobe epilepsy;"Bancaud J; Brunet-Bourgin F; Chauvel P; Halgren E";Journal Article;"Jackson (Brain 1898; 21: 580-90) observed that seizures arising in the medial temporal lobe may result in a 'dreamy state', consisting of vivid memory-like hallucinations, and/or the sense of having previously lived through exactly the same situation (deja vu). Penfield demonstrated that the dreamy state can sometimes be evoked by electrical stimulation of the lateral temporal neocortex, especially the superior temporal gyrus. Halgren et al. (Brain 1978; 101: 83-117) showed that the dreamy state can be evoked by stimulation ofthe hippocampal formation and amygdala and Gloor (Brain 1990; 113: 1673-94) has suggested that it is evoked by lateral stimulation only when the resulting after-discharge spreads medially. In order to resolve the relative importance of these areas, we considered the mental phenomena observed in epileptic patients with electrodes stereotaxically implanted into different brain areas for seizure localization prior to surgical treatment. Sixteen patients, all with seizures involving the temporal lobe, experienced the dreamy state either as a result of spontaneous seizures (nine dreamy stares in six patients), or due to electrical stimulation (43 in 14) or to chemical activation (five in three). Deja vu and hallucinations of scenes were often evoked by different stimulations of the same electrode in the same patient. As Jackson had also observed, the dreamy state could occur alone but was often associated with epigastric phenomena and fear, and followed by loss of contact and oro-alimentary automatisms, and then by simple gestural automatisms, all characteristic of partial seizures beginning in the medial temporal lobe. Furthermore, as also emphasized by Jackson, the dreamy state was seldom associated with sensory illusions. Stimulation of either the neocortex (15 occurrences), anterior hippocampus (17) or amygdala (10) could evoke a dreamy state. However, since Sewer hippocampal and amygdala leads were stimulated than temporal neocortical, the proportion of medial temporal electrodes where dreamy stares could be evoked was much higher than in the neocortex. Most responsive lateral temporal sites were located in the superior temporal gyrus, rather than the middle temporal gyrus which was significantly less responsive. In 85% of dreamy states evoked by medial temporal lobe stimulation, the discharge spread to the temporal neocortex; and In 53% of dreamy states evoked by lateral temporal stimulation, the discharge spread medially. Considering all dreamy states, the amygdala was involved (as the stimulated structure, or as the site of ictal- or after-discharge) in 73% of cases, the anterior hippocampus in 83% and the temporal neocortex in 88%. In every spontaneous seizure where the dreamy stare was observed, the amygdala, anterior hippocampus and temporal neocortex were all involved (provided that they were recorded during the seizure). Thus, we conclude that the dreamy state probably depends upon a neuronal network that engages both medial and lateral aspects of the temporal lobe, and that the anterior hippocampus, amygdala and superior temporal gyrus have relatively priviledged access to this circuit.";Excluded;NA;Neuro-atypical subjects;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445427;wos078;Vascular cognitive disorder: a new diagnostic category updating vascular cognitive impairment and vascular dementia;"Roman G C; Sachdev P; Royall D R; Bullock R A; Orgogozo J M; Lopez-Pousa S; Arizaga R;  Wallin A   ";Journal Article;"Conference:
1st Congress of the International-Society-for-Vascular-Behavioural-and-Cognitive-Disorders (VAS-COG 2003)

Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) was proposed as an umbrella term to include subjects affected with any degree of cognitive impairment resulting from cerebrovascular disease (CVD), ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to vascular dementia. VCI may or may not exclude the host of 'focal' circumscribed impairments of specialized functions such as language (aphasia), intentional gesture (apraxia), or categorical recognition (agnosia), among others, that may result from a stroke. Therefore, there are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria for VCI. We conclude that this concept could be more useful if it were to be limited to cases of vascular MCI without dementia, by analogy with the concept of amnestic MCI, currently considered the earliest clinically diagnosable stage of Alzheimer disease (AD). In agreement with our view, the Canadian Study on Health and Aging successfully implemented a restricted definition of VCI, excluding cases of dementia (i.e., vascular cognitive impairment no dementia, VCI-ND). The Canadian definition and diagnostic criteria could be utilized for future studies of VCI. This definition excludes isolated impairments of specialized cognitive functions.

Vascular dementia (VaD): The main problem of this diagnostic category stems from the currently accepted definition of dementia that requires memory loss as the sine qua non for the diagnosis. This may result in over-sampling of patients with AD worsened by stroke (AD+CVD). This problem was minimized in controlled clinical trials of VaD by excluding patients with a prior diagnosis of AD, those with pre-existing memory loss before the index stroke, and those with amnestic MCI. We propose a definition of dementia in VaD based on presence of abnormal executive control function, severe enough to interfere with social or occupational functioning.

Vascular cognitive disorder (VCD): This term, proposed by Sachdev [P. Sachdev, Vascular cognitive disorder. Int J Geriat Psychiatry 14 (1999) 402-403.] would become the global diagnostic category for cognitive impairment of vascular origin, ranging from VCI to VaD. It would include specific disease entities such as post-stroke VCI, post-stroke VaD, CADASIL, Binswanger disease, and AD plus CVD. This category explicitly excludes isolated cognitive dysfunctions such as those mentioned above. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In foregrounding the concept of Spracherleben, the lived experience of language, this article contributes to the ongoing debate on how to rethink the notion of the linguistic repertoire considering that current phenomena such as increased mobility, migration, or participation in transnational networks of communication make it difficult to take, as Gumperz (1964) did in his original concept, relatively stable speech communities as point of departure. The notion of the lived experience of language which I am elaborating here emphasizes the intersubjective dimension of language as a gesture toward the other and casts light on the often-neglected bodily and emotional dimensions of perception and speech.

The tsotsitaal phenomenon originated in the urban context of Johannesburg's racially mixed townships in the 1940s and it can now be found in all provinces. Although there are calls to recognise it as a 'national language', it is not clear what features the different regional varieties share. This article considers two regional examples of tsotsitaal - from Durban and Cape Town - to unpack their common features.
The data analysed here was gathered in 2012, and involves video recordings of 22 young adults, aged between 16 to 25, speaking tsotsitaal together. The data was analysed to determine: the grammatical framework of each example; the lexical items both common to, and unique to, the two sites; topics areas of relexicalisation; and the use of gestures and other semiotic markers.

The Tool-Cue Model postulates how our ancestors might have used tools both as functional instruments and as icons. The central thesis of the model treats communication as action systems mediated by signs, the central communicative action being the action cue: a communicative act that requires further behaviours to be satisfied. Tools are interpreted as framing devices, promoting the emergence of pragmatic/semantic duality. This latter feature is based on grammatical structures that include pragmatic and semantic meanings in the same utterance. Human language, i.e. symbolic pragmatics, appropriated the action cue meaning of tools and, simultaneously, transformed tools int symbolic 'warraants' by which modern humans transform both their speech and material behaviours into the types of social activities we intend.

22445713;wos084;Arthur's refusal to eat: ritual and control in the romance feast;Byrne A;Journal Article;Arthur's refusal to begin feasting before he has seen a marvel or heard a tale of adventure is a recurring motif in medieval romance. Previous comment on this ritual has suggested that the source for such a taboo on eating may be found in earlier narratives in the Celtic languages. This paper argues that, although the ritual almost certainly originates in pre-chivalric society, romance authors adapted and developed it to reflect the courtly-chivalric preoccupations of their own world. Arthur's ritual gesture may be seen as a means of containing and controlling both interior moral threats and exterior physical peril, and is intimately connected to the courtly conception of the feast. This study draws on the evidence of religious writing and courtesy manuals and explores some highly-developed treatments of the motif in romance in order to suggest that literary engagements with Arthur's refusal to eat have much to say about contemporary ideas of ritual and reality as mediated through the symbolically-charged arena of the medieval feast.

22445271;wos085;Complex leaf‐gathering skills of mountain gorillas (Gorilla g. beringei): Variability and standardization;"Byrne R W; Byrne J M E";Journal Article;"The skills that mountain gorillas use to deal with the stings, tiny hooks, and spines protecting common plant leaves in their diet were examined for variation within and between animals. Many elements of uni- and bimanual performance were identified, often involving delicate precision and coordination, and varying idiosyncratically, each individual having a different set of preferred elements. Many of these elements are functionally equivalent, and all but one weaned animals showed full processing capability; the history of the one exception suggests that early experience with the task may be important. Gorillas' idiosyncrasy in manual skill elements is entirely consistent with trial-and-error learning at this level. By contrast, each individual uses very few techniques (structured sequences of elements) for most processing, and these techniques are the same across the population. Where animals deviate from this generalization, they largely employ the simpler technique normally used for undefended leaves. Lateralization increases from start to finish, consistent with a logical structure in which each stage has a laterality bias and each stage is sequentially dependent on the last. Variations from their commonest techniques occur in all animals (on average, about nine variant techniques were recorded from each animal). The repertoire of techniques increases significantly with age, whereas the repertoire of elements does not. This points to an initial reliance on a single logical structuring that is well established by weaning (about 3.5 years), with subsequent development of the ability to vary the technique used so as to take advantage of variations in the environment. Standardization of logical organization, despite variability between different animals in individual elements and behavioral laterality, suggests that the logical ordering of elements and the interrelationships of processing stages is copied by program-level imitation.

However, it was systematic work with captive groups that revealed compelling evidence that chimpanzees use gestures to communicate in a flexible, goal-oriented, and intentional fashion [6-8], replicated across all great ape species in captivity [9-17] and chimpanzees in the wild [18, 19]. All of these aspects overlap with human language but are apparently missing in most animal communication systems, including great ape vocalization, where extensive study has produced meager evidence for intentional use ([20], but see [21, 22]). Findings about great ape gestures spurred interest in a potential common ancestral origin with components of human language [23-25]. Of particular interest, given the relevance to language origins, is the question of what chimpanzees intend their gestures to mean; surprisingly, the matter of what the intentional signals are used to achieve has been largely neglected. Here we present the first systematic study of meaning in chimpanzee gestural communication. Individual gestures have specific meanings, independently of signaler identity, and we provide a partial 'lexicon'; flexibility is predominantly in the use of multiple gestures for a specific meaning. We distinguish a range of meanings, from simple requests associated with just a few gestures to broader social negotiation associated with a wider range of gesture types.

Here, we study the ontogeny, and to some extent the phylogeny, of the ability to spontaneously relate iconic signals, gestures, and/or vocalizations, to previous experience. Children at 18, 24, and 36 months of age (N = 216) and great apes (N = 13) interacted with two apparatuses, each comprising a distinct action and sound. Subsequently, an experimenter mimicked either the action, the sound, or both in combination to refer to one of the apparatuses. Experiments 1 and 2 found no spontaneous comprehension in great apes and in 18-month-old children. At 24 months of age, children were successful with a composite vocalization-gesture signal but not with either vocalization or gesture alone. At 36 months, children succeeded both with a composite vocalization-gesture signal and with gesture alone, but not with vocalization alone. In general, gestures were understood better compared to vocalizations. Experiment 4 showed that gestures were understood irrespective of how children learned about the corresponding action (through observation or self-experience). This pattern of results demonstrates that iconic signals can be a powerful way to establish reference in the absence of language, but they are not trivial for children to comprehend and not all iconic signals are created equal.;Included;Excluded;Non-spontaneous communication;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23080870;wos091;Do Postures of Distal Effectors Affect the Control of Actions of Other Distal Effectors? Evidence for a System of Interactions between Hand and Mouth;"Gentilucci M; Campione G C";Journal Article;The present study aimed at determining whether, in healthy humans, postures assumed by distal effectors affect the control of the successive grasp executed with other distal effectors. In experiments 1 and 2, participants reached different objects with their head and grasped them with their mouth, after assuming different hand postures. The postures could be implicitly associated with interactions with large or small objects. The kinematics of lip shaping during grasp varied congruently with the hand posture, i.e. it was larger or smaller when it could be associated with the grasping of large or small objects, respectively. In experiments 3 and 4, participants reached and grasped different objects with their hand, after assuming the postures of mouth aperture or closure (experiment 3) and the postures of toe extension or flexion (experiment 4). The mouth postures affected the kinematics of finger shaping during grasp, that is larger finger shaping corresponded with opened mouth and smaller finger shaping with closed mouth. In contrast, the foot postures did not influence the hand grasp kinematics. Finally, in experiment 5 participants reached-grasped different objects with their hand while pronouncing opened and closed vowels, as verified by the analysis of their vocal spectra. Open and closed vowels induced larger and smaller finger shaping, respectively. In all experiments postures of the distal effectors induced no effect, or only unspecific effects on the kinematics of the reach proximal/axial component. The data from the present study support the hypothesis that there exists a system involved in establishing interactions between movements and postures of hand and mouth. This system might have been used to transfer a repertoire of hand gestures to mouth articulation postures during language evolution and, in modern humans, it may have evolved a system controlling the interactions existing between speech and gestures.;Included;Excluded;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Conference on Gesture in the Mediterranean
The present paper focuses on early stages of development exploring the emergence of the gesture language system in infancy and its evolution toward the adult system. Old and recent studies carried on mainly in our Laboratory are described and discussed.
According to the perspective that emerged in the late 1970s the findings on the role of gesture in the acquisition and development of language did not raise any particular interest in a wider audience. In more recent years a new theoretical framework emerging from different disciplines and perspectives (evolutionary, neuro-physiological, linguistic) made this approach to the ontogeny of language extremely relevant. Findings on the tight link between actions, gestures, and spoken words in young children support some hypotheses put forward by these different perspectives and are in accordance with this new theoretical framework.";Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this longitudinal study we explore the emergence and development of the first symbolic uses in triadic interaction contexts in a girl with Down syndrome between 12 and 18-months of age. We conducted five sessions of video recording, at 12, 131/2, 15, 161/2, and 18 months chronological age. At each session we videotaped the girl and her mother interacting with different objects. Data were coded in semiotic categories used in previous studies (Rodriguez & Moro, 1999) and a microgenetic analysis was conducted for each session. The first symbolic uses by the girl appeared at 131/2 months. Symbols were of different types and levels of complexity, and the adult had an important role in facilitating the production of these symbols. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We observed eight children in triadic interaction with one of their parents and 10 objects in a semi-structured situation at nine, 12, 15 and 18 months old. The children began to use objects symbolically at 12 months, and the duration and frequency increased with age. The highest percentage of the total frequency of symbolic uses, of the four levels identified, was level 1. The frequency of level 4, where two or more symbolic actions occur one after the other, giving rise to symbolic narratives', increased according to age. These data confirm that knowledge of the rules of canonical uses of objects are the meanings which first symbols base themselves on and that children use the symbolic uses that they are aware of to create symbolic narratives'.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The main theories of gesture acquisition are often portrayed as mutually exclusive, but only some theories actually detail learning mechanisms, and differences in the level of analysis may help explain some of the apparent disagreements. Gesture research would benefit greatly from the articulation of more testable hypotheses. We propose two hypotheses that follow from dominant theories of gesture acquisition. We urge scholars to collect new data and leverage existing data in ways that maximize the potential for comparison across datasets and articulation with studies of other communicative modalities. Finally, we advocate for a transition away from using intentionality as a marker of the special status' of gesture, and towards using gesture as a window onto the lives and minds of apes.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Firstly, that of the Vocabulaire europeen des philosophies: Dictionnaire des intraduisibles, which was published in 2004 by Editions du Seuil/Le Robert. This was an innovative tool that used the 'untranslatables' - defined as 'not that which is not translated, but that which one never stops (not) translating' - in order to explore the key symptoms of the differences between languages in the philosophies of Europe. Secondly, that of the translations and transpositions of this work, written originally in the French language (or metalanguage), into a dozen or so other languages, including English, Arabic, Ukrainian and Romanian, each of which brought to it a different set of concerns. The gesture of translating the original volume into different languages necessitates a genuine reflection on the weighty problem of the genie des langues (innate character or 'genius' of a language), and on translation itself as a form of philosophizing with differences.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445759;wos100;The Evolution of Video Processing Technology and Its Main Drivers;Caviedes J E;Journal Article;In this paper, we will discuss the evolution of consumer video processing technology as a result of the continuing influence of three main drivers: 1) the gap between source content and display technology, 2) emergence of new multimedia interaction paradigms that break away from the couch potato stereotype, and 3) performance-oriented SW/HW platforms that enable highly interactive and immersive experiences. The content-display gap reflects accelerated growth and progress in the two segments adjacent to video processing. It is characterized by the increased access and sheer amount of heterogeneous content that is available anytime, anywhere for users to view it on any display. Next come the multimedia interaction paradigms, which have continued evolving along new dimensions such as sensorial experience (e. g., haptic, voice, gestural), moved from lean-back toward lean-forward experience, and increased quality and variety of experience (i.e., immersive, social and affective interaction). Along with the first two drivers, the computing platform provides the means to deliver the most demanding user experiences, including best picture quality, web connectivity, immersiveness, and gestural user interfaces while optimizing overall system performance. The evolution of video processing has also led to the creation of new product concepts such as the Smart TV in which content consumption, visual experience, social experience, and immersiveness are integrated and delivered through a multiplicity of highly compelling applications.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445567;wos102;Gestural repertoire size is associated with social proximity measures in wild chimpanzees;"Roberts A I; Chakrabarti A; Roberts S G B";Journal Article;Studying the communication systems of primates can provide insights into the evolutionary origins of human language. Some theories propose that language evolved to help meet the demands of managing complex social relationships. Examining the associations between sociality and communication in the great apes can help to identify the specific selection pressures that may have been important for language evolution. In particular, gestural communication is believed to be important because it is a relatively recent trait seen only in primates and particularly in the great apes. However, the extent to which more complex gestural communication plays a role in managing social relationships, as compared to less complex gestural communication, is not well understood. Using social network analysis, we examined the association between complex gesturing (indexed as repertoire size) and complexity of social relationships indexed as proximity (the duration of time spent within 10 m, per hour spent in same party) in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). Repertoire size (the total number of gesture types a focal subject produced toward other individuals) and dyadic repertoire size (the number of gesture types produced toward the dyad partner, per hour spent within 10 meters) were positively associated with proximity at the level of the group (centrality in the proximity network) and the dyad (proximity duration between dyads), respectively. Further, the repertoire size of visual and auditory short-range gestures was positively associated with proximity, while the repertoire size of tactile gesture was negatively associated with proximity. Overall these results suggest that gestural repertoire size has important implications for maintaining social relationships in wild chimpanzees and more broadly that gestural communication may have played an important role in language evolution.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445206;wos105;Dysphagia or dysphagias during neuroleptic medication?;"Chaumartin N; Monville M; Lachaux B";Journal Article;"Introduction. - Dysphagia is a common symptom in the general population, and even more among psychiatric patients, but rarely seen as a sign of seriousness. It is a cause of death by suffocation, and more or less serious complications, and therefore should be diagnosed and treated. Among psychiatric patients, organic and iatrogenic aetiologies, as well as risk factors are identified, which worsen this symptom when associated. It is now accepted that neuroleptics can aggravate or cause dysphagia. They act by several pathophysiological ways on the different components of swallowing, which can be identified by dynamic tests in the upper aerodigestive tract endoscopy.
Literature findings. - This symptom is rarely reported by patients and often underestimated by caregivers. The frequency of swallowing disorders is not known. Dysphagia is a cause of complications and an increase in mortality rates among psychiatric patients. It has also been found that the average number of psychotropic drugs in patients who die by cafe coronary is significantly higher than in other patients. There are several phases in swallowing: oral,pharyngeal, and oesophageal. Swallowing disorders can affect each of these phases, or several at once: (a) Extrapyramidal syndrome: dysphagia is present in drug induced Parkinson's syndromes, but prevalence is not known. It is most often associated with another symptom of the extrapyramidal syndrome, but can also be isolated, making its diagnosis more difficult. Dysphagia is due to a slowing down in the oral and pharyngeal reflex, called bradykinesia; (b) Tardive dyskinesia: the oro-pharyngo-oesophageal dyskinesia is the most common type. Oesophageal dyskinesia causes asynchronous and random movements of the oesophagus, resulting in dysphagia. It appears mostly beyond 3 months of treatment with neuroleptics; (c) Acute laryngeal or oesophageal dystonia, associated or not with orofacial dystonia, is characterised by an impairment in the oesophageal muscle contraction and a hypertonia of the upper sphincter of the oesophagus; (d) Polyphagia or 'binge eating', is frequent in psychotic patients; (e) Finally, there are risk factors for dysphagia: xerostomia, poor dental status, advanced age, neurological diseases, polypharmacy, sedative drugs, CNS depression, etc., which worsen the symptom. Case report Mr J., aged 28, with no psychiatric history, is admitted to the Unit for Difficult Patients in Villejuif for behavioural disorder with homicide on the street. The patient was restrained by passers-by and suffers a head injury and a fracture of the transverse process of L1 vertebra. A cranial CT scan is performed in the emergency room, it is normal. The patient is not known to psychiatric services, and has never taken neuroleptics. Mr J. is homeless, known in his neighbourhood for 'his noisy delirium on the street and repeated alcohol abuse.' After being arrested by the police in this context, a first psychiatric examination is conducted. The medical certificate states that his condition is not compatible with custody. Mr J. remains mute; he has stereotyped gestures and strange attitudes. No delusion is verbalized. He receives vials of loxapine 50 mg causing sedation. At his arrival in the department, Mr J. has the same clinical picture, with a rigid and inexpressive face, reluctance, major unconformity, poor speech. The search for drugs in urine is positive for cannabis. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is rapidly raised, motivating further prescription of loxapine 300 mg daily in combination with clonazepam 6 mg daily. From the earliest days, dysphagia to solids with choking and regurgitation is noted, aggravated by the increase of loxapine treatment of 450 mg / day to 700 mg / day, 7 days after admission. A physical examination is performed before the worsening of dysphagia, it is normal, and in particular, reveals no extrapyramidal syndrome. An anti-cholinergic corrector is introduced, without clinical improvement. A new physical examination is performed; it is normal except for sedation and a slight deviation of the uvula. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy shows no anatomical lesion. No functional assessment of swallowing is done however.
At this stage, the suspicion of neuroleptic induced dysphagia appears to be the most likely hypothesis. Treatment with loxapine is then stopped, resulting in a very rapid clinical improvement. Aripiprazole 15 mg / d is introduced. Dysphagia does not reoccur.
Discussion. - Loxapine is an atypical antipsychotic, with a lower risk of neurological side effects than first generation of antipsychotics. These side effects are however numerous and from diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. Loxapine is an antagonist of dopamine and serotonin which is involved in the regulation of several neurotransmitters, explaining the multiple mechanisms involved in the onset of dysphagia: first, blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum, causing motor side-effects of central origin, in addition to peripheral effects of the molecule, which impairs swallowing. In principle, the antagonist activity on serotonin 5-HT2A receptors increases dopaminergic activity in the striatum, reducing the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia, without avoiding them completely. In addition to these mechanisms, cholinergic blockade reduces oesophageal mobility and pharyngeal reflex. Moreover, the antihistamine, anti-cholinergic and adrenergic receptor blocking alpha-1 can cause sedation, which aggravates the symptom. Finally, the depression of the bulbar centres reduces the swallowing reflex and gag reflex altering the intake of food.



Conclusions. - The swallowing disorder caused by neuroleptics may occur regardless of the molecule or drug class to which it belongs. It can be found even in the absence of any other neurological signs. It is important to search for the aetiological diagnosis for treatment. At the crossroads of several specialties, swallowing disorders are difficult to diagnose and treat. They are frequently underestimated, partly because patients rarely complain. In our case report, the diagnosis was ascertained by the removal of the medication, without functional evidence, probably by a lack of collaboration between the physician and the endoscopist who had not performed any dynamic investigation of swallowing. This case illustrates the importance of knowing the different mechanisms underlying dysphagia in psychiatric patients, and good communication with gastroenterologists to establish a precise diagnosis of the disorder, and adapt the therapy.

Their narratives were transcribed, and these ''scripts'' were given to actors of the same sex, who were videotaped as they tried to portray the original respondent in a convincing manner. Spontaneous portrayals did not differ from rehearsed versions of the same narratives in the proportion of time the speaker spent gesturing or in their rates of filled and silent pauses. However, spontaneous narratives were accompanied by more lexical movement and contained a greater proportion of intraclausal silent pauses. In a second experiment, naive subjects were shown both spontaneous and rehearsed versions and tried to select the spontaneous one. In different judgment conditions subjects (1) saw the video without sound, (2) only heard the sound track, or (3) both heard the sound and saw the picture. In all three judgment conditions, identification of the spontaneous version was better than chance, but subjects were reliably more accurate from the combined sound and picture than from either the sound or the picture alone.

These displays range from complex signals that involve impressive and challenging maneuvers, to simpler displays or no gesture at all. The factors that drive this evolution remain largely unclear, and we therefore investigate this issue in New World blackbirds by testing how factors related to a species' geographical distribution and social mating system predict macro-evolutionary patterns of display elaboration. We report that species inhabiting temperate regions produce more complex displays than species living in tropical regions, and we attribute this to (i) ecological factors that increase the competitiveness of the social environment in temperate regions, and (ii) different evolutionary and geological contexts under which species in temperate and tropical regions evolved. Meanwhile, we find no evidence that social mating system predicts species differences in display complexity, which is consistent with the idea that gestural displays evolve independently of social mating system. Together, these results offer some of the first insight into the role played by geographic factors and evolutionary context in the evolution of the remarkable physical displays of birds and other vertebrates.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Since the proposed radar does not require an illumination source, radio interference does not occur. To study parametrically the effect of the signal parameters on radar detection performance, a simulation was carried out by modeling the radar system in the discrete-time domain, and the results were verified experimentally using an actuator.

22445518;wos112;Vygotsky, Cognitive Development and Language New perspectives on the nature of grammaticalization;Christy T C;Journal Article;Lev Vygotsky's (1896-1934) views of the genesis of language and its relation to thought, illustrated here by his account of the origin of the pointing gesture, can be seen as anticipating current research in socially constituted cognition, pragmatics, developmental psychology and grammaticalization, in all of which the importance of contextual and pragmatic factors looms large. His conceptualization of the evolution of communication from action to semiosis has bearing on, and is illuminated by, recent developments in neurobiology, developmental psychology, primatology, and grammaticalization theory. Specifically, recently discovered mirror neuron systems may offer a neurophysiological platform for the evolution of language from gesture and imitation, for the transition from action to sign, from referential to relational meaning, an evolution in which the establishment of joint attention is pivotal. With his emphasis on the dynamic, socially constructed nature of signs, Vygotsky shares Humboldt's view of language as energeia, as a system in a perpetual state of emergence, a view consistent with Condillac's 'language of action', in which spontaneous vocalizations and gestures give rise to sign functions. Research of the grammaticalization pathways associated with demonstratives and modal particles also offers new perspectives on the process and hypothesized unidirectionality of grammaticalization, including the plausible claim that demonstratives represent a second and separate source of candidates for grammaticalization. Integrating grammaticalization research with findings from relevant social and natural sciences holds out the prospect of underwriting significant advances in understanding the origin of language and the emergence of grammar.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Yet, this theory may be criticized, since it seems to have some difficulty explaining the transition from gesture to speech, and the vocal outcome itself. This paper argues that it's possible to cope with these issues by relying on the Mimetic Hypothesis: in fact, mimesis may represent the cognitive missing link between gestural and verbal language, thus serving as cradle of speech. Finally, this paper maintains that it's possible to build a phylogenetic model of the origins of human language, whose focal point is precisely a mimetic stage.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Several communicative situations eliciting pointing gestures and symbolic gestures were presented to 81 participants in an experimental context. Results have highlighted some differences in hand shapes depending on the function of pointing: contrary to results reported in children, the proportion of index-finger gestures was higher in imperative situations than in declarative situations. The distance between the gesturer and the referent was also found to influence hand shapes, proximal pointing being more frequently associated with index-finger gestures than distal pointing. The comparison of hand preferences revealed a greater right-sided asymmetry for declarative pointing than for non-communicative activities, whereas there was no difference between imperative pointing and non-communicative activities, or between symbolic gestures and non-communicative activities. The present study thus sheds some light on the features and the roles of communicative gestures in adults.

22444822;wos118;The design and evolution of TurboTurtle, a collaborative microworld for exploring Newtonian physics;"Cockburn A; Greenberg S";Journal Article;TurboTurtle is a dynamic multi-user microworld for the exploration of Newtonian physics. With TurboTurtle, students can alter the attributes of the simulation environment, such as gravity, friction, and presence or absence of walls. Students explore the microworld by manipulating a variety of parameters, and learn concepts by studying the behaviours and interactions that occur. TurboTurtle has evolved into a 'group-aware' system where several students, each on their own computer, can simultaneously control the microworld and gesture around the shared display. TurboTurtle's design rationale includes concepts such as equal opportunity controls, simulation timing, concrete vs. abstract controls, recoverability, and how strictly views should be shared between students. Teachers can also add structure to the group's activities by setting the simulation environment to an interesting state, which. includes a set of problems and questions. Observations of pairs of young children using TurboTurtle highlight extremes in collaboration styles, from conflict to smooth interaction. Finally, the technical work in making TurboTurtle group-aware is slight, primarily because it was built with a groupware toolkit called GroupKit.

22445177;wos121;Communicating about quantity without a language model: Number devices in homesign grammar;"Coppola M; Spaepen E; Goldin-Meadow S";Journal Article;All natural languages have formal devices for communicating about number, be they lexical (e.g., two, many) or grammatical (e.g., plural markings on nouns and/or verbs). Here we ask whether linguistic devices for number arise in communication systems that have not been handed down from generation to generation. We examined deaf individuals who had not been exposed to a usable model of conventional language (signed or spoken), but had nevertheless developed their own gestures, called homesigns, to communicate. Study I examined four adult homesigners and a hearing communication partner for each homesigner. The adult homesigners produced two main types of number gestures: gestures that enumerated sets (cardinal number marking), and gestures that signaled one vs. more than one (non-cardinal number marking). Both types of gestures resembled, in form and function, number signs in established sign languages and, as such, were fully integrated into each homesigner's gesture system and, in this sense, linguistic. The number gestures produced by the homesigners' hearing communication partners displayed some, but not all, of the homesigners' linguistic patterns. To better understand the origins of the patterns displayed by the adult homesigners, Study 2 examined a child homesigner and his hearing mother, and found that the child's number gestures displayed all of the properties found in the adult homesigners' gestures, but his mother's gestures did not. The findings suggest that number gestures and their linguistic use can appear relatively early in homesign development, and that hearing communication partners are not likely to be the source of homesigners' linguistic expressions of non-cardinal number. Linguistic devices for number thus appear to be so fundamental to language that they can arise in the absence of conventional linguistic input. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

These are the ability of nonhuman primates to use manual action flexibly and intentionally, the nature of the primate mirror system and its homology with the language circuits in the human brain, the relative success in teaching apes to communicate manually rather than vocally, the ready invention of sophisticated signed languages by the deaf, the critical role of pointing in the way young children learn language, and the correlation between handedness and cerebral asymmetry for language. A gradual switch from manual to facial and vocal expression may have occurred late in hominin evolution, with speech reaching its present level of autonomy only in our own species, Homo sapiens.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444876;wos123;Language as gesture;Corballis M C;Journal Article;Language can be understood as an embodied system, expressible as gestures. Perception of these gestures depends on the 'mirror system,' first discovered in monkeys, in which the same neural elements respond both when the animal makes a movement and when it perceives the same movement made by others. This system allows gestures to be understood in terms of how they are produced, as in the so-called motor theory of speech perception. I argue that human speech evolved from manual gestures, with vocal gestures being gradually incorporated into the mirror system in the course of hominin evolution. Speech may have become the dominant mode only with the emergence of Homo sapiens some 170,100 years ago, although language as a relatively complex syntactic system probably emerged over the past 2 million years, initially as a predominantly manual system. Despite the present-day dominance of speech, manual gestures accompany speech, and visuomanual forms of language persist in signed languages of the deaf, in handwriting, and even in such forms as texting.

22445535;wos124;Language, Memory, and Mental Time Travel: An Evolutionary Perspective;Corballis M C;Journal Article;Language could not exist without memory, in all its forms: working memory for sequential production and understanding, implicit memory for grammatical rules, semantic memory for knowledge, and episodic memory for communicating personal experience. Episodic memory is part of a more general capacity for mental travel both forward and backward in time, and extending even into fantasy and stories. I argue that the generativity of mental time travel underlies the generativity of language itself, and could be the basis of what Chomsky calls I-language, or universal grammar (UG), a capacity for recursive thought independent of communicative language itself. Whereas Chomsky proposed that I-language evolved in a single step well after the emergence of Homo sapiens, I suggest that generative imagination, extended in space and time, has a long evolutionary history, and that it was the capacity to share internal thoughts, rather than the nature of the thoughts themselves, that more clearly distinguishes humans from other species.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Meeting on the Speciation of Modern Homo Sapiens
Although cerebral asymmetries abound in non-human animals, there are still reasons to suppose that there may have been a single-gene mutation producing a 'dextral' (D) allele, which created a strong bias toward right-handedness and left-cerebral dominance for language at some point in hominid evolution. The alternative 'chance' (C) allele is presumed directionally neutral, although there may be other influences producing weak population manual and cerebral asymmetries in the absence of the D allele. It is unlikely that this laterality gene is located in homologous regions of the X and Y chromosomes, as suggested by Crow (1998), but there is a case for supposing that it is located solely on the X chromosome. I argue that language evolved from manual gestures, and the D allele may have served to guarantee manual and vocal control in the same (left) hemisphere in the majority of humans. The 'speciation event' that distinguished Homo sapiens from other large-brained hominids may have been a switch from a predominantly gestural to a predominantly vocal form of language.";Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The. article contains a discussion of such issues as the links between theories of embodied cognition and embodiment in language, the role of lateralization in the evolution of language, the mimetic sources of the semantic mechanisms of language, the role of the process of conventionalization observable in modern-day sign languages, the role of gestures in speech and language acquisition, the possible role of facial gestures in the transition from manual to vocal language. Drawing evidence from genetics and the fossil record, the author argues for a relatively late completion of the evolution of speech. He argues for a gradual development of speech and grammar.

22445031;wos127;Precursors to Language;Corballis M C;Journal Article;One view of language is that it emerged in a single step in Homo sapiens, and depended on a radical transformation of human thought, involving symbolic representations and computational rules for combining them. I argue instead that language should be viewed as a communication system for the sharing of thoughts, and that thought processes themselves evolved well before the capacity to share them. One property often considered unique to language is generativity-the capacity to generate a potentially infinite variety of sentences. I suggest that generativity is derived from the understanding of space and the capacity to recall or construct spatiotemporal scenarios, and probably goes far back in the evolution of animals that move in spatial habitats. Another property essential to language is theory of mind, the ability to understand what others are thinking, which probably emerged from animal empathy and became more complex in hominin evolution. Language evolved for the sharing of experiences, whether remembered or constructed, perhaps initially through pantomime but gradually conventionalized into standardized forms, including speech. These developments probably took place gradually during the Pleistocene, rather than as a sudden event in the evolution of H. sapiens.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445008;wos128;The Evolution of Language;Corballis M C;Journal Article;Language, whether spoken or signed, can be viewed as a gestural system, evolving from the so-called mirror system in the primate brain. In nonhuman primates the gestural system is well developed for the productions and perception of manual action, especially transitive acts involving the grasping of objects. The emergence of bipedalism in the hominins freed the hands for the adaptation of the mirror system for intransitive acts for communication, initially through the miming of events. With the emergence of the genus Homo from some 2 million years ago, pressures for more complex communication and increased vocabulary size led to the conventionalization of gestures, the loss of iconic representation, and a gradual shift to vocal gestures replacing manual ones-although signed languages are still composed of manual and facial gestures. In parallel with the conventionalization of symbols, languages gained grammatical complexity, perhaps driven by the evolution of episodic memory and mental time travel, which involve combinations of familiar elements-Who did what to whom, when, where, and why? Language is thus adapted to allow us to share episodic structures, whether past, planned, or fictional, and so increase survival fitness.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444998;wos129;The Evolution of Lateralized Brain Circuits;Corballis M C;Journal Article;In the vast clade of animals known as the bilateria, cerebral and behavioral asymmetries emerge against the backdrop of bilateral symmetry, with a functional trade-off between the two. Asymmetries can lead to more efficient processing and packaging of internal structures, but at the expense of efficient adaptation to a natural world without systematic left-right bias. Asymmetries may arise through the fissioning of ancestral structures that are largely symmetrical, creating new circuits. In humans these may include asymmetrical adaptations to language and manufacture, and as one or other hemisphere gains dominance for functions that were previously represented bilaterally. This is best illustrated in the evolution of such functions as language and tool manufacture in humans, which may derive from the mirror-neuron system in primates, but similar principles probably apply to the many other asymmetries now evident in a wide range of animals. Asymmetries arise in largely independent manner with multi-genetic sources, rather than as a single over-riding principle.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445277;wos131;What's left in language? Beyond the classical model;Corballis M C;Journal Article;Until recently it was widely held that language, and its left-hemispheric representation in the brain, were uniquely human, emerging abruptly after the emergence of Homo sapiens. Changing views of language suggest that it was not a recent and sudden development in human evolution, but was adapted from dual-stream circuity long predating hominins, including a system in nonhuman primates specialized for intentional grasping. This system was gradually tailored for skilled manual operations (praxis) and communication. As processing requirements grew more demanding, the neural circuits were increasingly lateralized, with the left hemisphere assuming dominance, at least in the majority of individuals. The trend toward complexity and lateralization was probably accelerated in hominins when bipedalism freed the hands for more complex manufacture and tool use, and more expressive communication. The incorporation of facial and vocal gestures led to the emergence of speech as the dominant mode of language, although gestural communication may have led to generative language before speech became dominant. This scenario provides a more Darwinian perspective on language and its lateralization than has been commonly assumed.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In exemplifying the claim, I show how, in both face-to-face dialogue and text messaging, felt experience is yoked to verbal patterning. Language activity is multi-scalar, individual, and collective: people mesh vocal, manual, and gestural techniques with embodied coordination. People gain cognitive skills that link historically derived patterns with how, as vertebrates, they mesh perception with action (in percaction). This view applies to evolution, know-how, and individual-collective agency: as people draw on the logic shown in the Taiji Yin-Yang emblem, they use language to change the bio-ecology (plant-animal-human-cultural formations) as cultural products transform terrestrial life. It is concluded that recognition of the simplex nature of language can help linguists and semioticians play a major part in reducing the degradation of the living world.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445068;wos135;Alignment of two languages: The spreading of mouthings in Sign Language of the Netherlands;"Bank R; Crasborn O; van Hout R";Journal Article;Mouthings and mouth gestures are omnipresent in Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT). Mouthings in NGT are mouth actions that have their origin in spoken Dutch, and are usually time aligned with the signs they co-occur with. Frequently, however, they spread over one or more adjacent signs, so that one mouthing co-occurs with multiple manual signs. We conducted a corpus study to explore how frequently this occurs in NGT and whether there is any sociolinguistic variation in the use of spreading. Further, we looked at the circumstances under which spreading occurs. Answers to these questions may give us insight into the prosodic structure of sign languages. We investigated a sample of the Corpus NGT containing 5929 mouthings by 46 participants. We found that spreading over an adjacent sign is independent of social factors. Further, mouthings that spread are longer than non-spreading mouthings, whether measured in syllables or in milliseconds. By using a relatively large amount of natural data, we succeeded in gaining more insight into the way mouth actions are utilised in sign languages.;Included;Excluded;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

23080877;wos138;Functional dynamics of spoken and signed word production: A case study using electrocorticographic spectral analysis;"Crone NE; Hao L";Journal Article;"Background: Event-related changes in the EEG power spectrum have recently been used to study functional brain activation in humans. Like traditional event-related potentials, event-related spectral changes provide information about the temporal evolution of cortical activation that is difficult to obtain with fMRI or PET. These spectral changes include event-related suppression of power in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) and even-related augmentation of power in the gamma band (>30 Hz). Most studies of the gamma band have focused on frequencies in and around 40 Hz. Using electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals recorded with subdural electrodes implanted for the surgical management of epilepsy, we have also observed a broadband augmentation of power in higher gamma frequencies (>80 Hz). This index of cortical activation has compared favourably with alpha suppression and with electrical cortical stimulation mapping in Studies utilising simple motor and auditory processing, but such a comparison has not been done for tasks requiring more complex language processing.
Aims: We used two different spectral indices of cortical activation-alpha power suppression and gamma power augmentation, to study the spatial and temporal patterns of human cortical activation during different word production tasks.
Methods: Subdural ECoG electrodes were implanted for clinical purposes in a patient with normal hearing, who had learned sign language as an adult and later developed intractable epilepsy. We measured event-related spectral changes during language tasks with different input and output modalities: Picture naming and word reading (visual inputs), and word repetition (auditory input) were performed with spoken responses (oral-articulatory output) and with signed responses (manual-gestural output). In addition we used a visually guided motor task to map tongue and hand representations independent of language.
Results: Speech and signing differentially activated tongue and hand regions of sensorimotor cortex. Although posterior superior temporal gyrus was activated early during auditory word repetition, picture naming and word reading also activated this region, albeit slightly later, consistent with phonological and/or lexical-semantic processing. In contrast. basal temporal-occipital cortex was activated earlier and with greater magnitude during picture naming and word reading than during word repetition, Suggesting semantic processing or object and word recognition. In all of the tasks, event-related gamma augmentation occurred in more discrete spatial and temporal patterns than event-related alpha suppression.
Conclusions: Event-related alpha suppression and gamma augmentation provide complementary information about task-related cortical activation.

This has led to the development of different methods to examine both archaeological items and their production processes. These methods have attempted to segment the actions that form an operational sequence, usually with the aim of quantifying the complexity involved in lithic knapping. However, to date, no study has been capable of cataloguing these actions to the point of characterizing the elements that comprise them. In this work, we propose an approach to identify the smallest unit of any knapping action: the manual gesture. Our goal is to provide a homogeneous language allowing the characterization and quantification of 1) the variability between lithic industries, and 2) the evolution of technological complexity, from both synchronic and diachronic view. As a proof-of-concept, we designed a pilot experiment to characterize the manual gestures involved in making choppers, chopping-tools and handaxes. Our results confirm the reliability of this approach. In addition, it points to the existence of a gestural primordial core that lasted throughout the Oldowan and the Acheulean -as knapping sequences increased in complexity- and the potential to identify some specific traits of the individual knappers.;Included;Excluded;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

22445376;wos143;Novel motor gestures for phonation during inspiration enhance the acoustic complexity of birdsong;"Goller F; Daley M A ";Journal Article;Sound generation based on a pulmonary mechanism typically occurs during the expiratory phase of respiration. Phonation during inspiration has been postulated for the calls of some amphibians and for exceptional sounds in some, human languages. No direct evidence exists for phonation during inspiration in birds, but such a mechanism has been proposed to explain very long uninterrupted songs. Here, we report the first physiological evidence for inspiratory sound production in the song of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). Motor gestures of the vocal and respiratory muscles leading to the production of inspiratory phonation differ from those of silent inspirations during song as well as from those leading to phonation during expiration. Inspiratory syllables have a high fundamental frequency, which makes them acoustically distinct from all other zebra finch song syllables. Furthermore, young zebra finches copy these inspiratory syllables from their tutor song, producing them during inspiration. This suggests that physical limitations confine the production of these sounds to the inspiratory phase in zebra finches. These findings directly demonstrate how novel respiratory-vocal coordination call enhance the acoustic structure of birdsong, and thus provide insight into the evolution of song complexity.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We highlight those symbolic elements which would later constitute the mythical language about the sacred space-temporality. Inside this space-temporality a rich spectrum of mythical images develops; images capable of explaining the relationships of the creation plans. Without a religious perception of the temporality, the conceptualization of the axis would remain a philosophical approach. Through our point of view, the two are born simultaneously. Thanks to them, creation can be imagined. The first 'frozen' formula of the mystical human spirit can be thought, brought to a palpable reality, expressed in an oral and then a written form. Studied together, temporality (sacred or not) and space are permanently imagined together. For example, a loss of mundane temporality in the secret ecstasy that offers to the soul an ascending direction does not mean getting out of universal temporality, but of its mundane section. In the sacred space the soul relates to time. Even the gods are submitted by the sacred, Aeon sometimes being synonymous to destiny. The universal creator seems to evade every touch, but not consistently, only when he avoids the descent into its created worlds. In sacredness, time and space seem or become confused, both expressing the same reality, by the immediate swing from thinking to deed. The mythical imagery conceives the displacement in the primary space-temporality by the spoken word. So, for something to appear and live, the spoken word is required. Even the divine dream appears as a pre-word of a creator's thought. The thought follows the spoken word, the spoken word follows the gestures which finally indicate the meanings of the creative act, controlling the rhythm of the creation days. These three will later be adapted through imitation in rite. We are now situated at the limit of the physical world, a real challenge for the mythical imagery. The general feature of the mythical expression on the creation of the material world is the state of the divinity's exhaustion, most often conceptualized by sacrifice or divine fatigue. The world geography identifies with the anatomy of a self-gutted god. Practically, material creation is most likely the complete revelation of God's body autopsy. As each body decomposes, everything in it is an illusion. An axial approach of the phenomenon exists in all religious systems. The created element's origin is exterior, with or without a pre-existing matter, by a god's sacrifice or only because it has to be that way. This is the starting point of the discussion on the symbolism of axiality as a reason for the constitution of the language of creation, capable of retelling the imaginary construction of myth in an oral and then written form.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445110;wos145;Orangutans modify facial displays depending on recipient attention;"Waller BM; Caeiro CC; Davila-Ross M";Journal Article;Primate facial expressions are widely accepted as underpinned by reflexive emotional processes and not under voluntary control. In contrast, other modes of primate communication, especially gestures, are widely accepted as underpinned by intentional, goal-driven cognitive processes. One reason for this distinction is that production of primate gestures is often sensitive to the attentional state of the recipient, a phenomenon used as one of the key behavioural criteria for identifying intentionality in signal production. The reasoning is that modifying/producing a signal when a potential recipient is looking could demonstrate that the sender intends to communicate with them. Here, we show that the production of a primate facial expression can also be sensitive to the attention of the play partner. Using the orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) Facial Action Coding System(OrangFACS), we demonstrate that facial movements are more intense and more complex when recipient attention is directed towards the sender. Therefore, production of the playface is not an automated response to play (or simply a play behaviour itself) and is instead produced flexibly depending on the context. If sensitivity to attentional stance is a good indicator of intentionality, we must also conclude that the orangutan playface is intentionally produced. However, a number of alternative, lower level interpretations for flexible production of signals in response to the attention of another are discussed. As intentionality is a key feature of human language, claims of intentional communication in related primate species are powerful drivers in language evolution debates, and thus caution in identifying intentionality is important.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Because of its physical nature, speech is both easier to compare with other species' behaviors and easier to study in the fossil record than other aspects of language. Here I argue that convergent fossil evidence indicates adaptations for complex vocalizations at least as early as the common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans. Furthermore, I argue that it is unlikely that language evolved separately from speech, but rather that gesture, speech, and song coevolved to provide both a multimodal communication system and a musical system. Moreover, coevolution must also have played a role by allowing both cognitive and anatomical adaptations to language and speech to evolve in parallel.

22445019;wos150;Strategic interactions: Games of the Ju|'hoan;de Voogt A;Journal Article;Three strategic games played by the Ju|'hoan-a board, a card, and a gesture game-complicate the rhetorics that suggest an evolutionary or psychological significance of play. They are mostly played by adults, although every individual adult does not necessarily engage in each game. The Ju|'hoan card and board game practices were transmitted through contact across large parts of Botswana and Namibia, while the gesture game n!ai has been known in other San communities. It suggests that the significance of strategic games is more likely found in its potential for social interaction (i.e., allowing to overcome cultural divides) than in evolution and psychology. Within the anthropological literature, strategy games were thought to be absent in egalitarian societies, such as that of the Ju|'hoan. Here, the roles of power, competition, and winning were thought to be disruptive and unwanted. A closer examination of the details behind the Ju|'hoan games shows that not only were strategy games adopted and adapted from neighboring societies but that the game of n!ai was developed by the Ju|'hoan into a competitive one.

It argued that reading acquisition, in all cultures, recycles preexisting cortical circuits dedicated to invariant visual recognition, and that the organization of these circuits imposes strong constraints on the invention and cultural evolution of writing systems. In this article, seven years later, I briefly review new experimental evidence, particularly from brain imaging studies of illiterate adults, which indicates that reading acquisition invades culturally universal cortical circuits and competes with their prior function, including mirror-invariant visual recognition and face processing. In response to my critics, I emphasize how brain plasticity and brain constraints can be reconciled within the Bayesian perspective on learning. I also discuss the importance of a newly discovered gesture system in reading and writing. Finally, I argue that there is consistent evidence for deep cross-cultural universals in writing systems, as well as for the multiple subtypes of dyslexia that are expected given the broad set of areas recruited by the reading task.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445212;wos154;The ontogenesis of narrative: from moving to meaning;"Delafield-Butt J T; Trevarthen C";Journal Article;Narrative, the creation of imaginative projects and experiences displayed in expressions of movement and voice, is how human cooperative understanding grows. Human understanding places the character and qualities of objects and events of interest within stories that portray intentions, feelings, and ambitions, and how one cares about them. Understanding the development of narrative is therefore essential for understanding the development of human intelligence, but its early origins are obscure. We identify the origins of narrative in the innate sensorimotor intelligence of a hypermobile human body and trace the ontogenesis of narrative form from its earliest expression in movement. Intelligent planning, with self-awareness, is evident in the gestures and motor expressions of the mid-gestation fetus. After birth, single intentions become serially organized into projects with increasingly ambitious distal goals and social meaning. The infant imitates others' actions in shared tasks, learns conventional cultural practices, and adapts his own inventions, then names topics of interest. Through every stage, in simple intentions of fetal movement, in social imitations of the neonate, in early proto-conversations and collaborative play of infants and talk of children and adults, the narrative form of creative agency with it four-part structure of introduction,' 'development,'climax,' and 'resolution' is present. We conclude that shared rituals of culture and practical techniques develop from a fundamental psychomotor structure with its basic, vital impulses for action and generative process of thought-in-action that express an integrated, imaginative, and sociable Self. This basic structure is evident before birth and invariant in form throughout life. Serial organization of single, non-verbal actions into complex projects of expressive and explorative sense-making become conventional meanings and explanations with propositional narrative power. Understanding the root of narrative in embodied meaning-making in this way is important for practical work in therapy and education, and for advancing philosophy and neuroscience.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

22445475;wos157;Body language: The interplay between positional behavior and gestural signaling in the genus Pan and its implications for language evolution;"Smith L W; Delgado R A";Journal Article;"Objectives: The gestural repertoires of bonobos and chimpanzees are well documented, but the relationship between gestural signaling and positional behavior (i.e., body postures and locomotion) has yet to be explored. Given that one theory for language evolution attributes the emergence of increased gestural communication to habitual bipedality, this relationship is important to investigate.
Materials and Methods: In this study, we examined the interplay between gestures, body postures, and locomotion in four captive groups of bonobos and chimpanzees using ad libitum and focal video data.
Results: We recorded 43 distinct manual (involving upper limbs and/or hands) and bodily (involving postures, locomotion, head, lower limbs, or feet) gestures. In both species, actors used manual and bodily gestures significantly more when recipients were attentive to them, suggesting these movements are intentionally communicative. Adults of both species spent less than 1.0% of their observation time in bipedal postures or locomotion, yet 14.0% of all bonobo gestures and 14.7% of all chimpanzee gestures were produced when subjects were engaged in bipedal postures or locomotion. Among both bonobo groups and one chimpanzee group, these were mainly manual gestures produced by infants and juvenile females. Among the other chimpanzee group, however, these were mainly bodily gestures produced by adult males in which bipedal posture and locomotion were incorporated into communicative displays.
Discussion: Overall, our findings reveal that bipedality did not prompt an increase in manual gesturing in these study groups. Rather, body postures and locomotion are intimately tied to many gestures and certain modes of locomotion can be used as gestures themselves. Am J Phys Anthropol 157:592-602, 2015.

Initially, the software was also classified as being either open (high in user control) or closed (lower in user control), giving two programs in each category within each subject domain. The subjects' interactions (verbal and gestural) with each other as they used the programs were video-recorded and coded, and the resulting data factor-analysed for each program. Cluster analysis of the factor solutions yielded groups of software, which corresponded in part with the original open-closed classification, but which also qualified it in the case of some of the programs. Two major clusters, each of three programs, emerged. One cluster was comprised of three closed programs, whilst the other was comprised of two open programs plus one program that we had initially classified as closed. The remaining two programs were separate outliers. It was concluded that software style does indeed affect the patterns of interactions among pairs of users; for example, the group of programs that were more closed were associated with greater amounts of explaining whilst the group of programs that were more open were associated with greater amounts of assessing and confirming (i.e. taking stock of progress).

We report here a novel behaviour of food requesting from humans displayed by wild bonnet macaques Macaca radiata, an Old World cercopithecine primate, in the Bandipur National Park of southern India. Using both natural observations and field experiments, we examined four different behavioural components-coo-calls, hand-extension gesture, orientation, and monitoring behaviour-of food requesting for their conformity with the established criteria of intentional communication. Our results suggest that food requesting by bonnet macaques is potentially an intentionally produced behavioural strategy as all the food requesting behaviours except coo-calls qualify the criteria for intentionality. We comment on plausible hypotheses for the origin and spread of this novel behavioural strategy in the study macaque population and speculate that the cognitive precursors for language production may be manifest in the usage of combination of signals of different modalities in communication, which could have emerged in simians earlier than in the anthropoid apes.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

22445603;wos161;Relationship between limb dyspraxia and dyslexia in children with learning disabilities;"Dewaele J; Bartolo A; Macchi L;  Cautillon M E";Journal Article;"Gestures and language are thought as two cognitive functions that are closely linked. From an evolutionary point of view, recent theories suggest that language evolved from manual gestures, rather than from animal vocal call. Moreover, in developmental psychology, several studies have revealed the role of gestures in the development of language abilities. In neuropsychology, the recent cognitive models of praxis processing have been mapped onto the cognitive models of written language processing, further suggesting an analogy between the way gestures and higher language abilities are processed. If gestures have a role in language development, a deficit in processing gestures should affect reading abilities. We report the case of five children (three with visuo-constructive disorders, two with dyslexia and one with both visuo-constructive disorder and dyslexia) who were tested using a series of tasks targetting reading and praxis abilities. Tasks assessing recognition, comprehension and production of gestures and language were included to evaluate the integrity of the lexical routes. Tasks to evaluate imitation of meaningless gestures and the ability to read pseudo-words were also included to investigate the sub-lexical routes. Results showed that children having visuo-constructive disorders were also affected by limb dyspraxia and dyslexia and that the language and praxis profiles based on the cognitive models were similar. In particular, the two children with visuo-constructive disorders showed a deficit at the lexical and sub-lexical routes for both gestures and language; the child with both dyslexia and visuo-constructive disorders had difficulties in the production of meaningful gestures and in meaningless actions imitation, as well as in reading words and pseudo-words. This pattern of results was compatible with a deficit at the level of the buffers as proposed by the two cognitive models. The two dyslexic children did not show any sign of limb dyspraxia, and their dyslexia was mainly attributed to a deficit to the lexical and sub-lexical route in one case; and to the sub-lexical route in the other case. Overall, results showed that those children with deficits in gesture processing also had difficulties in reading, but that children presenting only dyslexia did not show any sign of praxis impairments. Taken together, these findings are in line with the idea that gesture might play a role in the development of language abilities.

The rejection by many developmental psychologists of a behaviorist account of language acquisition has led to a modular and distinctly nativist psychology of language (cf. Pinker, 1994, 1997; Pinker & Bloom, 1990). Little has been said about the role or nature of learning mechanisms in the evolution of language. Although Place does not provide any defense of a behaviorist linguistic ontogeny, this is no reason to rule out his phylogenetic speculations.

Moreover, demonstratives play an important role in the organization of discourse and the diachronic evolution of grammar, which arguably is also motivated by their communicative function to establish joint attention.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Whereas affective bursts, for example, laughter, have an intrinsic communicative role bound to social behavior, vegetative sounds, for example, snoring, just signal autonomic-physiological states. However, the latter events, for example, belching, may also be used as intentional communicative actions (vocal gestures), characterized by an arbitrary culture-dependent sound-to-meaning (semiotic) relationship, comparable to verbal utterances. Using a decision task, hemodynamic responses to affective bursts, vegetative sounds, and vocal gestures were measured by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Affective bursts elicited activation of anterior left superior temporal gyrus. In contrast, arbitrary vocal gestures yielded hemodynamic reactions of the left temporo-parietal junction. Conceivably, a listener's interpretation of nonverbal utterances as intentional events depends upon a lefthemisphere temporo-parietal 'auditory-to-meaning interface' related to our mechanisms of speech processing.;Included;Excluded;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

If in a compositional sense his creations give account of the arrival of the architectural avant-gardes to the national milieu, his use of the stylistic repertoire is far from being attached to the canons established for those languages.
The dominant eclectic spirit of his buildings was shaped after a formal syncretism, quoting not only the styles in vogue at that time-Picturesque Revival, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and Nationalist Restoration-but also including his personal imagery inhabited by bizarre figures, close in their sensitivity to the oneiric world and the Grutesco.
The peculiar amalgamation of imageries, along with architectural references to high and low culture, seen from the distance of the present, emerged as gestures very close to current postmodern sensibility. This would explain the great popularity enjoyed by his creations among the general public, which acknowledges their originality and singularity in the local context.

Some contemporary research about nonverbal behavior studies the theme of gestures and expressions as a universal language. This conception is quite traditional and began to be analysed, disputed and refined in the 19th century when gestures and expressions were becoming scientific subjects. During this period there were divergent strategies for tackling the problem. That of Mantegazza justified universality by considering differences of expressions as regional particularities. Other strategies, involved, for example, the comparison, by Gratiolet, of human and animal gestures purely through analogy or were couched in an evolutionary view of human origins, by Darwin, who saw animal gestures as precursors of human gestures. There were also anthropological or ethnological enquiries about universality by Darwin and Mantegazza; here, universality took on the role of hypothesis.

These applications provide support for groups of people working together by facilitating their communication and by reacting adaptively to the perceived contexts of an ongoing interaction. Applications in Neem explore the multimodal context of mostly human-to-human communication, by 'overhearing' conversations, monitoring user actions and reacting to perceived opportunities for augmentation via intelligent system interventions.



The Neem Platform is designed to facilitate the integration of functionality for capture and reification of user communicative actions over a variety of modalities (e.g. speech, text, gestures), as well as facilitate analysis and reasoning based on this reified context. The platform promotes an exploratory and evolutionary style of development by affording rapid development of components, enactment of human-controlled real-time (Wizard of Oz) experiments, and remote collection of data for off-line analysis of interactions.

22445278;wos175;Cognitive foundations of topic-comment and foreground-background structures: Evidence from sign languages, cospeech gesture and homesign;Engberg-Pedersen E;Journal Article;Krifka (2006, 2007b) suggests that asymmetric bimanual coordination and ultimately the evolution of lateralization in humans may be the cognitive basis of linguistic topic-comment structure and foreground-background structures in general. As asymmetric bimanual constructions abound in sign languages and are also found in their possible precursors, cospeech gesture and homesign, sign languages may serve as a test ground for the hypothesis. Asymmetric bimanual constructions are indeed used for differentiating foreground and background in sign languages, but some of these constructions are derived from indexical gestures, not manipulation, i.e., they draw on visual attention. Signed topics may be marked by nonmanual features derived from signals of visual attention, and the defining feature of signed topics is eye contact with the addressee, needed to establish a communicative common ground. There, thus, seems to be not one embodied origin of topic-comment structures, but several. Finally, signed topic-comment structure demonstrates how attention shifts in the course of the entire structure, thereby explaining how topics can be described alternately as foreground (e.g., Talmy 2007: 265) and background (Jacobs 2001).;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445727;wos177;Multi-Modal Deep Hand Sign Language Recognition in Still Images Using Restricted Boltzmann Machine;"Rastgoo R; Kiani K; Escalera S";Journal Article;In this paper, a deep learning approach, Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), is used to perform automatic hand sign language recognition from visual data. We evaluate how RBM, as a deep generative model, is capable of generating the distribution of the input data for an enhanced recognition of unseen data. Two modalities, RGB and Depth, are considered in the model input in three forms: original image, cropped image, and noisy cropped image. Five crops of the input image are used and the hand of these cropped images are detected using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). After that, three types of the detected hand images are generated for each modality and input to RBMs. The outputs of the RBMs for two modalities are fused in another RBM in order to recognize the output sign label of the input image. The proposed multi-modal model is trained on all and part of the American alphabet and digits of four publicly available datasets. We also evaluate the robustness of the proposal against noise. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-modal model, using crops and the RBM fusing methodology, achieves state-of-the-art results on Massey University Gesture Dataset 2012, American Sign Language (ASL). and Fingerspelling Dataset from the University of Surrey's Center for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing, NYU, and ASL Fingerspelling A datasets.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445013;wos178;Grammar came later: Triality of patterning and the gradual evolution of language;Everett D L;Journal Article;This paper argues that language is primarily a tool for communication, not primarily a means of thought expression, It makes the case that language has its roots in intentional iconicity of Australopithecines and probably had reached the level of a G1 grammar (linear ordering of symbols + gestures) some 2.5 million years ago. Other forms of language, e.g. hierarchical, recursive grammars, are later embellishments that are neither necessary nor sufficient to have human language. The paper looks in detail at the evolution of culture among early hominins and how gap between indexes and icons to symbols might have been bridged. It then discusses the basic composition of phonology, morphology and syntax. The paper rejects the idea of a proto-language, as it also rejects the 'X-men' view of language evolution/mutation proposed in Berwick and Chomsky (2016). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

22444874;wos179;The social structure of language and consciousness in GeorgeHerbert Mead;Fabbrichesi R;Journal Article;"This essay focuses on George H. Mead's Mind, Self and Society (1934). In his seminal work, Mead gives birth to social psychology, differentiating it from pure behaviorism. Mead focuses on an observable activity - the gesture, the act - and yet he distances himself from behaviorism because he does not deny the inner experience of the individual. On the contrary, he is particularly concerned with the rise of inner experience within the process as a whole. The process of the formation of consciousness works from the outside to the inside. Consciousness is mostly to be explained, not to be certified; what must be explained is its development, its function, its usefulness. Mead maintained that consciousness has a social origin (like his contemporary Vygotsky), and that it is the outcome, and not the origin, of the process of communication (like Darwin). This process begins with a 'conversation of gestures', continues with what Mead calls 'taking the role of the other', and ends up with a social architecture of significant symbols. The Self appears as a Social Self, a Generalized Other made possible especially by that particular form of gesture that is the vocal gesture. I will insist on the particular form of 'genealogy of consciousness' that Mead underlined, trying to clear up its novelty in reference to the metaphysical and psychological tradition. The inward-looking individual seems to fail to see his proper Self, because the truth of the Self lies in the outward and dynamical relations with others.";Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These data, along with paleoanthropological evidence, suggest that prelinguistic vocal substrates for protolanguage that had prosodic features similar to contemporary motherese evolved as the trend for enlarging brains in late australopithecines/early Homo progressively increased the difficulty of parturition, thus causing a selective shift toward females that gave birth to relatively undeveloped neonates. hypothesized that hominin mothers adopted new foraging strategies that entailed maternal silencing, reassuring, and controlling of the is hypothesized behaviors of physically removed infants (i.e., that shared human babies' inability to cling to their mothers' bodies). As mothers increasingly used prosodic and gestural markings to encourage juveniles to behave and to follow, the meanings of certain utterances (words) became conventionalized. This hypothesis is based on the premises that hominin mothers that attended vigilantly to infants were strongly selected for, and that such mothers had genetically based potentials for consciously modifying vocalizations and gestures to control infants, both of which receive support from the literature.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Dance also has been reported in a small number of non-human primate species, in particular apes. However, its function has not been systematically evaluated. We observed 357 intentional, rhythmic, and nonverbal dance displays performed by four adult female cao vit gibbons (Nomascus nasutus) residing in four polygynous groups during 3000 h of observation in Bangliang, Guangxi, China. Females used dance to solicit copulations, as well as to promote a social bond with the group's lone adult male. In addition, this display appears to represent a form of non-aggressive competition among adult females living in the same group. We found that a female who had a weaker social relationship with the breeding male increased her social and sexual access to the male by an increase in dancing frequency. Given that gibbons dance in various behavioral contexts, and appears to serve several important social and sexual functions, a greater understanding of this form of gestural communication offers an instructive model for examining the origin and evolution of dance in humans and other apes.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Special attention is paid to the idioms of biblical Hebrew and the force of the original sounds that can hardly be reproduced in other languages.

23080841;wos183;Interactive environments for music and multimedia;"Camurri A; Ferrentino P";Journal Article;Multimodal Environments (MEs) are systems capable of establishing creative, multimodal user interaction by exhibiting real-time adaptive behaviour. In a typical scenario, one or more users are immersed in an environment allowing them to communicated by means of full-body movement, singing or playing. Users get feedback from the environment in real time in terms of sound, music, visual media, and actuators, i.e. movement of semi-autonomous mobile systems including mobile scenography, on-stage robots behaving as actors or players, possibly equipped with music and multimedia output. MEs are therefore a sort of extension of augmented reality environments. From another viewpoint, an ME can be seen as a sort of prolongation of the human mind and senses. From an artificial intelligence perspective, an ME consists of a population of physical and as software agents capable of changing their reactions and their social interaction over time. For example, a gesture of the user(s) can mean different things in different situations, and can produce changes in the agents populating the ME. The paradigm adopted for movement recognition is that of a human observer of the dance, where the focus of attention changes according to the evolution of the dance itself and of the music produced. MEs are therefore agents able to observe the user, extract 'gesture gestalts', and change their state, including artificial emotions, over time. MEs open new niches of application, many still to be discovered, including music, dance, theatre, interactive arts, entertainment, interactive exhibitions and museal installations, information atelier, edutainment, training, industrial applications and cog nitive rehabilitation (e.g. for autism). The environment can be a theatre, a museum, a discotheque, a school classroom, a rehabilitation centre for patients with a variety of sensory/motor and cognitive impairments, etc. The ME concept generalizes the bio-feedback methods which already have found widespread applications. The paper introduces MEs, then a flexible ME architecture, with a special focus on the modeling of the emotional component of the agents forming an ME.

22444867;"Camurri A; Ferrentino P";The Infochemical Core;"Hernandez-Fernandez A; Ferrer-i-Cancho R";Journal Article;Vocalizations, and less often gestures, have been the object of linguistic research for decades. However, the development of a general theory of communication with human language as a particular case requires a clear understanding of the organization of communication through other means. Infochemicals are chemical compounds that carry information and are employed by small organisms that cannot emit acoustic signals of an optimal frequency to achieve successful communication. Here, we investigate the distribution of infochemicals across species when they are ranked by their degree or the number of species with which they are associated (because they produce them or are sensitive to them). We evaluate the quality of the fit of different functions to the dependency between degree and rank by means of a penalty for the number of parameters of the function. Surprisingly, a double Zipf (a Zipf distribution with two regimes, each with a different exponent) is the model yielding the best fit although it is the function with the largest number of parameters. This suggests that the worldwide repertoire of infochemicals contains a core which is shared by many species and is reminiscent of the core vocabularies found for human language in dictionaries or large corpora.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There is a conceptual obstacle at the basis of this skepticism: the connection with Cartesian tradition. To propose a genuinely naturalistic perspective, the models of language inspired by Cartesianism must give way to those tied to the Darwinian perspective. Hence, we propose a model of language origins and functioning based on two hypotheses: (a) the origin of human language is interpretable in reference to the grounding of language in context; (b) the capacities that ensure this grounding are connected to the motor foundation of human communication.

Aims: We test fast mapping from a speaker's gaze and pointing towards objects in children with ASC and ID with varying chronological and receptive language ages compared with receptive language matched groups of typically developing (TD) children.
Methods and Procedure: Across eight trials, a speaker gazed and/or pointed towards one out of two objects while saying a new word. Pointing was either 'referential' (with intention), or 'incidental' (without obvious intention). To investigate whether children formed more robust word to-object links rather than associative word-to-location ones, we reversed the original location of the objects in half of the test trials.
Outcomes and Results: Children with ASC were as successful as TD children using social cues to form word-to-object mappings. Surprisingly, children with ID did not fast map from referential pointing, or when objects changed location.

These patients present with deficits such as imitating meaningful or meaningless gestures and in dexterity or purposeful use of objects. The different forms of apraxia originate from lesions of different levels/structures of the motor system, reflecting its complexity. Apraxias are caused by deficits in motor programmes generated in the frontal motor areas, in modality-specific higher sensorimotor control, or at the highest level of motor planning and motor conception. The types of apraxia differentially affect activities of daily living and hence show marked differences in the prognosis of recovery and the physiotherapeutic treatment required.

22445222;wos191;Bipedal tool use strengthens chimpanzee hand preferences;"Braccini S; Lambeth S; Schapiro S; Fitch W T";Journal Article;The degree to which non-human primate behavior is lateralized, at either individual or population levels, remains controversial. We investigated the relationship between hand preference and posture during tool use in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) during bipedal tool use. We experimentally induced tool use in a supported bipedal posture, an unsupported bipedal posture, and a seated posture. Neither bipedal tool use nor these supported conditions have been previously evaluated in apes. The hypotheses tested were 1) bipedal posture will increase the strength of hand preference, and 2) a bipedal stance, without the use of one hand for support, will elicit a right hand preference. Results supported the first, but not the second hypothesis: bipedalism induced the subjects to become more lateralized, but not in any particular direction. Instead, it appears that subtle pre-existing lateral biases, to either the right or left, were emphasized with increasing postural demands. This result has interesting implications for theories of the evolution of tool use and bipedalism, as the combination of bipedalism and tool use may have helped drive extreme lateralization in modern humans, but cannot alone account for the preponderance of right-handedness.

22445208;wos193;Clapping in chimpanzees: Evidence of exclusive hand preference in a spontaneous, bimanual gesture;Fletcher A W;Journal Article;An increased understanding of spontaneous bimanual tasks performed by chimpanzees would enhance the ongoing debate on population handedness in this species, and thus shed light on the evolution of hemispheric lateralization in humans. However, documentation of such bimanual activities has been largely absent in the literature because such behavior is infrequently observed in the natural repertoire of this species. This study presents data on a simple, spontaneous bimanual gesture'clap'-that was investigated in a naturalistic group of 26 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Sixteen individuals exhibited a total of 657 bouts of clapping directed toward humans, usually in the context of food availability. Most individuals were exclusive in their dominant hand preference, but since there was no population bias to the right or the left, the population is placed at level 3 of McGrew and Marchant's [yearbbook of Physical Anthropology 40:201-232, 1997] laterality framework. This is the first reported evidence of level 3 laterality in a non-tool-using task. Clapping increased in frequency with age, being common in adults, present at lower rates in adolescents, and absent in infants and juveniles. There was no effect of rearing or sex. The lack of population bias to the left or right for this bimanual gesture has implications for the debate on the evolution of language.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Specifically, language is often thought to depend on highly structured intentional action and mutual mindreading by a communicator and recipient. Whilst similar abilities in animals can shed light on the evolution of intentionality, they remain challenging to detect unambiguously. We revisit animal intentional communication and suggest that progress in identifying analogous capacities has been complicated by (i) the assumption that intentional (that is, voluntary) production of communicative acts requires mental-state attribution, and (ii) variation in approaches investigating communication across sensory modalities. To move forward, we argue that a framework fusing research across modalities and species is required. We structure intentional communication into a series of requirements, each of which can be operationalised, investigated empirically, and must be met for purposive, intentionally communicative acts to be demonstrated.

Symposium on the Sapient Mind - Archaeology Meets Neuroscience
Determining the brain adaptations that underlie complex tool-use skills is an important component in understanding the physiological bases of human material culture. It is argued here that the ways in which humans skilfully use tools and other manipulable artefacts is possible owing to adaptations that integrate sensory - motor and cognitive processes. Data from brain-injured patients and functional neuroimaging studies suggest that the left cerebral hemisphere, particularly the left parietal cortex, of modern humans is specialized for this purpose. This brain area integrates dynamically representations that are computed in a distributed network of regions, several of which are also left-lateralized. Depending on the nature of the task, these may include conceptual knowledge about objects and their functions, the actor's goals and intentions, and interpretations of task demands. The result is the formation of a praxis representation that is appropriate for the prevailing task context. Recent evidence is presented that this network is organized similarly in the right- and left-handed individuals, and participates in the representation of both familiar tool-use skills and communicative gestures. This shared brain mechanism may reflect common origins of the human specializations for complex tool use and language.";Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While it is well established that great apes test and practise the majority of their gestural signals during play interactions, the influence of demographic factors and kin relationships between the interactants on the form and variability of gestures are relatively little understood. We thus carried out the first systematic study on the exchange of play-soliciting gestures in two chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) communities of different subspecies. We examined the influence of age, sex and kin relationships of the play partners on gestural play solicitations, including object-associated and self-handicapping gestures. Our results demonstrated that the usage of (i) audible and visual gestures increased significantly with infant age, (ii) tactile gestures differed between the sexes, and (iii) audible and visual gestures were higher in interactions with conspecifics than with mothers. Object-associated and self-handicapping gestures were frequently used to initiate play with same-aged and younger play partners, respectively. Our study thus strengthens the view that gestures are mutually constructed communicative means, which are flexibly adjusted to social circumstances and individual matrices of interactants.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Similarly, it is well established that our closest living relatives, the great apes, communicate with signals characterized by at least first-order intentionality. Despite the well-documented influence of developmental experiences on socio-cognitive abilities in apes, the developmental trajectory of intentional signal use as well as effects of social exposure remain poorly understood under naturalistic conditions. Here, we addressed these issues by studying the ontogeny of intentional communication in chimpanzee infants of two subspecies (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii/verus) and communities living in their natural environments. Overall, we found that gestures and bimodal signal combinations were most commonly accompanied by markers of intentional communication: audience checking, persistence to the goal, and sensitivity to recipient's attentional state. Within individuals, the proportion of communicative behaviours associated with goal persistence and sensitivity to attention increased with age. Cross-sectional comparisons between infants revealed an age effect on the use of audience checking. Context, interaction partner and site affiliation affected the production of specific markers irrespective of infants' age. The present study provided hitherto undocumented evidence for the development of three important markers of intentional communication in great apes. Moreover, our results suggest that social exposure impacts early intentional signal use.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445598;wos202;Michelangelo's Resurrected Christ: The First Version of the Sculpture and the Young Bernini;Frommel C L;Journal Article;It was probably already in 1512 that the young Roman patrician Metello commissioned Michelangelo to carve a statue of resurrected Christ for the funerary chapel of his aunt Marta Porcari. Michelangelo started to work on the sculpture in 1514 but quickly abandoned it, when he came across a black vein near the nose. The statue has been re- discovered only recently and is interpreted as an earlier version of the statue for S. Maria sopra Minerva, executed by Michelangelo around 1519/1520. Michelangelo's drawing, now in Munich, seems to be a preparatory sketch for this earlier version, as it still takes into account the slightly flatter block of marble, originally destined for the figures of Prisoners in the tomb of Julius II, and less expansive gestures. The altar to which the statue belonged was dedicated to Resurrection, and in both versions the shroud indeed falls down to show Christ completely naked, as it was the case only in the moment of the Resurrection. Still in the early seventeenth century the block had been substantially re-worked, and at that so clumsily that Michelangelo's nephew sold the sculpture for the mere value of the material to Marques Giustiniani. This patron of Caravaggio and of many other talented artists, seems to have commissioned the young Bernini, who in 1618 had volunteered to do the job, to finish the sculpture slightly later, and apparently destined it for the chapel of his family, located in the vicinity of Michelangelo's Christ. Bernini changed the disposition of the left arm and decidedly distanced himself from Michelangelo's artistic language, in that he employed his own idiom which was closer to nature, modelled on Hellenistic sculpture, and apparently influenced by Caravaggio and the religious sentiment of the Caracci.

Yet, Giustiniani must have had doubts about Christ's total nudity and decided to keep the statue in his palace.

23080815;wos203;Speed-curvature relations in speech production challenge the 1/3 power law;"Perrier P; Fuchs S ";Journal Article;Relations between tangential velocity and trajectory curvature are analyzed for tongue movements during speech production in the framework of the 1/3 power law, discovered by Viviani and colleagues for arm movements. In 2004, Tasko and Westbury found for American English that the power function provides a good account of speech kinematics, but with an exponent that varies across articulators. The present work aims at broadening Tasko and Westbury's study 1) by analyzing speed-curvature relations for various languages (French, German, Mandarin) and for a biomechanical tongue model simulating speech gestures at various speaking rates and 2) by providing for each speaker or each simulated speaking rate a comparison of results found for the complete set of movements with those found for each movement separately. It is found that the 1/3 power law offers a fair description of the global speed-curvature relations for all speakers and all languages, when articulatory speech data are considered in their whole. This is also observed in the simulations, where the motor control model does not specify any kinematic property of the articulatory paths. However, the refined analysis for individual movements reveals numerous exceptions to this law: the velocity always decreases when curvature increases, but the slope in the log - log representation is variable. It is concluded that the speed - curvature relation is not controlled in speech movements and that it accounts only for general properties of the articulatory movements, which could arise from vocal tract dynamics or/and from stochastic characteristics of the measured signals.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445726;wos206;Animal choreography of song and dance: a case study in the Montezuma oropendola, Psarocolius montezuma;"Miles M C; Fuxjager M J";Journal Article;Many multimodal displays incorporate choreography, which occurs when animals modulate how body movements are timed across the display. Choreography typically involves pairing specific gestures with vocalizations. This allows the signaller to effectively produce a display that is more complex than either of its components in isolation. Moreover, some animals appear to use a special case of choreography that can augment vocal performance. Expanding the multimodal framework to incorporate choreography is therefore a necessary step towards understanding how combining two signals into one impacts a display's structure. We explore this in a case study of free-living Montezuma oropendolas, Psarocolius montezuma, a polygynous songbird that performs a dramatic song and dance. We found that two elements of this display (bow and wing spread), are each choreographed with the song's loudest note (dB(max)) and lowest peak frequency (LPF), respectively. This suggests that oropendolas electively time the swing and wing spread gesture with key song elements. Interestingly, there was a correlation between the depth of an individual's swing and LPF, which was not explained by body size or social context. However, social context did predict a difference in vocal performance in terms of frequency modulation. Meanwhile, there was no relationship between wing display performance and dB(max). This means that oropendolas choreograph their swing gesture to predict LPF, which might reflect an individual's motor skill or even directly influence vocal performance. Altogether, our data suggest that animals can incorporate phenotypically distinct forms of choreography into their display repertoire, where each instance of choreography serves as an opportunity to generate a novel signal when one did not exist before.

Mead's understanding of human speech (what Mead often referred to as the vocal gesture) is remarkably consistent with today's interdisciplinary field that studies speech as a natural behavior with an evolutionary history. Mead seems to have captured major empirical and theoretical insights more than half a century before the contemporary field began to take shape. In that field the framework known as Tinbergen's Four Questions, developed in ecology to study naturally occurring behavior in nonhuman animals, has been an effective organizing framework for research on human speech. It is used in this paper to organize the comparison of Mead with contemporary scholars. The analysis concludes that Mead was, in a sense, beyond the Four Questions by recognizing the limitations of reductionist methods in understanding the nature of conscious phenomena, especially language. Mead's socially situated model of the nature of human speech makes him relevant to today's field where some see an undervaluation of the treatment of language as a social process.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Recently a growing number of studies have proposed a link between Broca's area's involvement in action processing and its involvement in speech. The present quantitative meta-analysis set out to test whether neuroimaging studies on imitation and overt speech show overlap within inferior frontal gyrus. By means of activation likelihood estimation (ALE), we investigated concurrence of brain regions activated by object-free hand imitation studies as well as overt speech studies including simple syllable and more complex word production. We found direct overlap between imitation and speech in bilateral pars opercularis (BA 44) within Broca's area. Subtraction analyses revealed no unique localization neither for speech nor for imitation. To verify the potential of ALE subtraction analysis to detect unique involvement within Broca's area, we contrasted the results of a meta-analysis on motor inhibition and imitation and found separable regions involved for imitation. This is the first meta-analysis to compare the neural correlates of imitation and overt speech.

22445064;wos210;It must be (logic), Yes, yes: Deconstruction's Critical Force;Gaon S;Journal Article;Jacques Derrida regularly appeals to an affirmative gesture that is 'prior' to or more 'originary' than the form of the question, and this suggests one way to understand deconstruction's critical force. The 'Yes, yes', he says, situates a 'vigil or beyond of the question'with respect to an 'irreducible responsibility'. Some Derrida scholars therefore construe the double affirmation as a source or ground of critique. In this paper, I refute this suggestion. While an originary 'Yes, yes' or 'come' (viens) does open the fields of (for example) 'inheritance', language, or `holistic webs', I argue, it only marks (will have marked) the processes of differance or of trace that make signification possible in general. No thing, as such, is thereby affirmed. This is why the originary affirmation cannot be said to constitute, in itself, the imperative (il la faut) of the logic (la logique) of ethical-political critique. To explain why a certain ethical imperative can be associated with deconstruction, one must determine why one is always already subject to a vigil that opens critique to its own possibility. One must also determine how the affirmative gesture relates to deconstruction's critical force.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This article investigates the mimesis hypothesis in relation to the evolution of teaching. The fundamental capacities that distinguish hominin teaching from that of other animals are demonstration and pantomime. A conceptual analysis of the instructional and communicative functions of demonstration and pantomime is presented. Archaeological evidence that demonstration was used for transmitting the Oldowan technology is summarized. It is argued that pantomime develops out of demonstration so that the primary objective of pantomime is that the onlooker learns the motoric patterns shown in the pantomime. The communicative use of pantomime is judged to be secondary. This use of pantomime is also contrasted with other forms of gestures. A key feature of the analysis is that the meaning of a pantomime is characterized by the force patterns of the movements. These force patterns form the core of a model of the cognitive mechanism behind pantomime. Finally, the role of pantomime in the evolution of language is also discussed.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The intensity and sustained interaction between writer and dancers which informed these writings confers on them a particular transgeneric status, termed here 'chore'-recits' [choreo-narratives], as texts originally for dance performance and now for reading. The accounts emerging from interviews with the dancers about the factors shaping their career and their art frequently laid bare the constraints, both personal and professional, which through dance they sought to express or transcend, a feature which resonates with Nimier's own abiding exploration of social, familial and interpersonal politics. More fundamentally, the hybrid focus of the collection nourishes a sustained and suggestive reflection on the relationship between verbal and gestural language and art.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445680;wos216;Olive baboons, Papio anubis, adjust their visual and auditory intentional gestures to the visual attention of others;"Bourjade M; Meguerditchian A; Maille A; Gaunet F; Vauclair J";Journal Article;Although nonhuman primates' gestural communication is often considered to be a likely precursor of human language, the intentional properties in this communicative system have not yet been entirely elucidated. In particular, little is known about the intentional nature of monkeys' gestural signalling and related social understanding. We investigated whether olive baboons can (1) adjust their requesting gestures to the visual attention of the experimenter with special emphasis on the state of the eyes (open versus closed), and (2) flexibly tailor visual and auditory-based gestures to elaborate their communication as a function of whether or not the experimenter can see them. Using a food-requesting paradigm, we found monkeys able to favour either visual or auditory-based requesting gestures to match the experimenter's visual attention. Crucially, when the human was not visually attending, they silenced visual gestures to some extent but performed more attention-getting gestures. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of monkeys elaborating attention-getting signals to compensate for communication breakdown. Gestural communication was also supported by gaze alternation between the experimenter's face and the food, especially when the human was visually attending. These findings offer evidence that olive baboons understand the state of the eyes in others' visual attention and use requesting gestures intentionally. They emphasize that Old World monkeys shift to acoustic communication when the recipient is not visually attending. In contrast to that of human infants and great apes, this acoustic communication is purely gestural, not vocal. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

23080783;wos217;Recognizing human gestures in videos by modeling the mutual context of body position and hands movement;Gavrilescu M;Journal Article;In our days, due the evolution of high-speed computers, the old Human-Computer Interface (HCI) legacies based on mouse and keyboard are slowly becoming obsolete and cannot be accurate enough and respond in a timely manner to the flow of information today. This is why new ways of communicating with the computer have to be researched, the most natural one being the use of gestures. In this paper, a two-level architecture for recognizing human gestures from video frames is proposed. The architecture makes use of several feed-forward neural networks to compute the gestures based on the Haar-like features of body, hand and finger as well as a stochastic-free context grammar that is employed to comprise the mutual context between body pose and hand movement. Trained and tested on 10 gestures (Swipe Right, Swipe Left, Swipe Up, Swipe Down, Horizontal Wave, Vertical Wave, Circle, Point, Palm Up and Fist) the over 94 % accuracy of the system surpasses the current state of the art and compared with a system with no mutual context between body position and hand movement our proposed architecture shows an increase in accuracy with up to 7 %.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445639;wos219;Vocal-gestural combinations in infant bonobos: new insights into signal functional specificity;Genty E;Journal Article;Comparing the communicative abilities of humans and great apes is a commonly used research strategy to understand the evolutionary foundation of modern human language. The ability to combine signals from different communicative modes (vocal, gestural, facial, etc.) is a universal and important feature of human language that is shared with great apes, although rarely investigated. Research on apes' signal combination has usually studied the frequency, distribution, effectiveness, and function of combinations in comparison with single signals, but only seldom have studies addressed their functional specificity, i.e., their ability to convey specific signallers' goals within contexts. Here, I suggest a new methodological approach to the investigation of functional specificity of signals, which consists of focusing on one call type and exploring its various patterns of production when combined with gestures. I illustrate the different methodological steps with a case study on infant bonobos' combinations of Pout moan' calls with gestures in the context of infant-to-mother requests. The descriptive results indicate that at least three combinations seem functionally specific, i.e., specific to the infants' desired goals. It suggests that combinations can be functionally specific from a young age and that learning how to combine signals efficiently might occur early in ontogeny. This suggested approach might provide insight to the on-going debate regarding the mechanisms underpinning the learning process of successful signal production and potentially further our understanding of the evolution of the combinatorial characteristics of human communication.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this study, we assessed the signalling behaviour in relation to four social goals of sex in this species: appeasement after conflict, tension reduction, social bonding and reproduction. Overall, sexual behaviour was strongly decoupled from its ancestral reproductive function with habitual use in the social domain, which was accompanied by a corresponding complexity in communication behaviour. We found that signalling behaviour varied systematically depending on the initiator's goals and gender. Although all gestures and vocalisations were part of the species-typical communication repertoire, they were often combined and produced flexibly. Generally, gestures and multi-modal combinations were more flexibly used to communicate a goal than vocalisations. There was no clear relation between signalling behaviour and success of sexual initiations, suggesting that communication was primarily used to indicate the signaller's intention, and not to influence a recipient's willingness to interact sexually. We discuss these findings in light of the larger question of what may have caused, in humans, the evolutionary transition from primate-like communication to language.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23080797;wos222;Taking the intentional stance at 12 months of age;"Gergely G; Nádasdy Z; Csibra G; Bíró S";Journal Article;This paper reports a habituation study indicating that 12-month-old infants can take the ''intentional stance'' in interpreting the goal-directed spatial behavior of a rational agent. First, we examine previous empirical claims suggesting that the ability to attribute intentions to others emerges during the second half of the first year. It is argued that neither the perceptual evidence (concerning the early ability to discriminate agents), nor the behavioral data (indicating the use of communicative gestures for instrumental purposes) are sufficient to support such claims about the early appearance of a theory of mind, as there are alternative explanations for these phenomena in terms of simpler psychological processes. It is then suggested that to show that an infant indeed attributes an intention to interpret the goal-directed behavior of a rational agent, one needs to demonstrate that the baby can generate an expectation about the most rational future means action that the agent will perform in a new situation to achieve its goal. We then describe a visual habituation study that meets this requirement. The results demonstrate that based on the equifinal structure of an agent's spatial behavior, 12-month-old infants can identify the agent's goal and interpret its actions causally in relation to it. Furthermore, our study indicates that infants of this age are able to evaluate the rationality of the agent's goal-directed actions, which is a necessary requirement for applying the intentional stance.

The foundation of cooperative verbal communication is taking turns to speak. Given the universality of turn-taking [4], it is natural to ask how it evolved. We used marmoset monkeys to explore whether another primate species exhibits cooperative vocal communication by taking turns. Marmosets share with humans a cooperative breeding strategy and volubility. Cooperative care behaviors are thought to scaffold prosocial cognitive processes [5,6]. Moreover, marmosets and other callitrichid primates are very vocal and readily exchange vocalizations with conspecifics [7-11]. By measuring the natural statistics of marmoset vocal exchanges, we observed that they take turns in extended sequences and show that this vocal turn-taking has as its foundation dynamics characteristic of coupled oscillators one that is similar to the dynamics proposed for human conversational turn-taking [12]. As marmoset monkeys are on a different branch of the evolutionary tree that led to humans, our data demonstrate convergent evolution of vocal cooperation. Perhaps more importantly, our data offer a plausible alternative scenario to 'gestural origin' hypotheses for how human cooperative vocal communication could have evolved.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I analyse Leslie Marmon Silko's novel Almanac of the Dead (1991) as a text which theorises anti-colonial and anti-capitalist resistance by materialising spiritual resurgence. Almanac blurs the boundaries between materiality and spirituality and reveals the limits of the language of globalisation for reading the text's anti-colonial gesture. I argue that Silko contests frameworks of secular modernity in two central ways: first, by disrupting accounts of linear time, and second by de-centring the role of human agency in revolution. Drawing on original archival research from the Leslie Marmon Silko Papers, I show how Almanac is a genre-defying text in active conversation with late Cold War imperialist conflicts in South America and Marxist theories of revolution. The political force of Silko's novel, however, lies not only in its representation of late capital in the settler colonial nation-state, but in its capacity to imagine other worlds beyond the strictures of colonial modernity. Challenging conceptions of the autonomous subject of agency, and disrupting the progressive temporality of resistance movements, Silko's novel proposes new critical imaginaries for thinking dissent in communion with the sacred.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

22445478;wos228;Intersensory Redundancy and 7-Month-Old Infants' Memory for Arbitrary Syllable-Object Relations;"Gogate L J; Bahrick L E";Journal Article;Seven-month-old infants require redundant information, such as temporal synchrony, to learn arbitrary syllable-object relations (Gogate & Bahrick, 1998). Infants learned the relations between 2 spoken syllables, /a/ and /i/, and 2 moving objects only when temporal synchrony was present during habituation. This article presents 2 experiments to address infants' memory for these relations. In Experiment 1, infants remembered the syllable-object relations after 10 min, only when temporal synchrony between the vocalizations and moving objects was provided during learning. In Experiment 2, 7-month-olds were habituated to the same syllable-object pairs in the presence of temporal synchrony and tested for memory after 4 days. Once again, infants learned and showed emerging memory for the syllable-object relations 4 days after original learning under the temporally synchronous condition. These findings are consistent with the view that prior to symbolic development, infants learn and remember word-object relations by perceiving redundant information in the vocal and gestural communication of adults.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I address this question by widening the lens with which we look at language to include the manual modality. I suggest that human communication is most effective when it makes use of two types of formats--a discrete and segmented code, produced simultaneously along with an analog and mimetic code. The segmented code is supported by both the oral and the manual modalities. However, the mimetic code is more easily handled by the manual modality. We might then expect mimetic encoding to be done preferentially in the manual modality (gesture), leaving segmented encoding to the oral modality (speech). This argument rests on two assumptions: (1) The manual modality is as good at segmented encoding as the oral modality; sign languages, established and idiosyncratic, provide evidence for this assumption. (2) Mimetic encoding is important to human communication and best handled by the manual modality; co-speech gesture provides evidence for this assumption.

Sign was once viewed as nothing more than a system of pictorial gestures without linguistic structure. More recently, researchers have argued that sign is no different from spoken language, with all of the same linguistic structures. The pendulum is currently swinging back toward the view that sign is gestural, or at least has gestural components. The goal of this review is to elucidate the relationships among sign language, gesture, and spoken language. We do so by taking a close look not only at how sign has been studied over the past 50 years, but also at how the spontaneous gestures that accompany speech have been studied. We conclude that signers gesture just as speakers do. Both produce imagistic gestures along with more categorical signs or words. Because at present it is difficult to tell where sign stops and gesture begins, we suggest that sign should not be compared with speech alone but should be compared with speech-plus-gesture. Although it might be easier (and, in some cases, preferable) to blur the distinction between sign and gesture, we argue that distinguishing between sign (or speech) and gesture is essential to predict certain types of learning and allows us to understand the conditions under which gesture takes on properties of sign, and speech takes on properties of gesture. We end by calling for new technology that may help us better calibrate the borders between sign and gesture.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here we use a novel elicitation paradigm to investigate the systematicity, emergence, and development of the noun-verb distinction (qua objects vs. actions) in an established sign language, American Sign Language (ASL), an emerging sign language, Nicaraguan Sign Language (NSL), and in the precursor to NSL, Nicaraguan homesigns. We show that a distinction between nouns and verbs is marked (by utterance position and movement size) and thus present in all groups-even homesigners, who have invented their systems without a conventional language model. However, there is also evidence of emerging crosslinguistic variation in whether a base hand is used to mark the noun-verb contrast. Finally, variation in how movement repetition and base hand are used across Nicaraguan groups offers insight into the pressures that influence the development of a linguistic system. Specifically, early signers of NSL use movement repetition and base hand in ways similar to homesigners but different from signers who entered the NSL community more recently, suggesting that intergenerational transmission to new learners (not just sharing a language with a community) plays a key role in the development of these devices. These results bear not only on the importance of the noun-verb distinction in human communication, but also on how this distinction emerges and develops in a new (sign) language.*;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445273;wos232;Enacting stories, seeing worlds: Similarities and differences in the cross-cultural narrative development of linguistically isolated deaf children;"Van Deusen-Phillips S B; Goldin-Meadow S; Miller PJ";Journal Article;The stories that children hear not only offer them a model for how to tell stories, but they also serve as a window into their cultural worlds. What would happen if a child were unable to hear what surrounds them? Would such children have any sense that events can be narrated and, if so, would they narrate those events in a culturally appropriate manner? To explore this question, we examined children who did not have access to conventional language - deaf children whose profound hearing deficits prevented them from acquiring the language spoken around them, and whose hearing parents had not yet exposed them to a conventional sign language. We observed 8 deaf children of hearing parents in two cultures, 4 European-American children from either Chicago or Philadelphia, and 4 Taiwanese children from Taipei, all of whom invented gesture systems to communicate. All 8 children used their gestures to recount stories, and those gestured stories were of the same types, and of the same structure, as those told by hearing children. Moreover, the deaf children seemed to produce culturally specific narrations despite their lack of a verbal language model, suggesting that these particular messages are so central to the culture as to be instantiated in nonverbal as well as verbal practices.

Academy Colloquium on Biology of Language
Can a child who is not exposed to a model for language nevertheless construct a communication system characterized by combinatorial structure? We know that deaf children whose hearing losses prevent them from acquiring spoken language, and whose hearing parents have not exposed them to sign language, use gestures, called homesigns, to communicate. In this study, we call upon a new formal analysis that characterizes the statistical profile of grammatical rules and, when applied to child language data, finds that young children's language is consistent with a productive grammar rather than rote memorization of specific word combinations in caregiver speech. We apply this formal analysis to homesign, and find that homesign can also be characterized as having productive grammar. Our findings thus provide evidence that a child can create a combinatorial linguistic system without external linguistic input, and offer unique insight into how the capacity of language evolved as part of human biology.

22445363;wos234;The ontogeny of triadic cooperative interactions with humans in an infant gorilla;Gomez J C;Journal Article;This paper reports a longitudinal study on the ontogeny of triadic cooperative interactions (involving coordinations of objects and people) in a hand-reared lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) from 6 months to 36 months of age. Using the behavioural categories developed by Hubley and Trevarthen (1979) to characterize the origins of 'secondary intersubjectivity' in human babies between 8-12 months of age, I chart the emergence of comparable coordinations of gestures and actions with objects and acts of dyadic communication. The findings show that the categories and concepts of secondary intersubjectivity are applicable to the gorilla, who engages with people in cooperative actions with objects. The ontogeny of triadic interaction in the gorilla was very similar to that described in human infants, but more extended in time and with some peculiarities, such as the absence of pointing and showing gestures, some of whose functions might be taken over by contact gestures which in human infants may appear later in development. The results do not support claims of human uniqueness in the development of cooperative action, but suggest a heterochrony in some aspects of the ontogeny of triadic interactions leading to a divergence between gorilla and human infants within secondary intersubjectivity.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Subsequent cortical differentiation, beginning at age two, creates distinct, relatively modularized capacities for linguistic grammar and more complex combination of objects.

Despite much attention, the question of how this key cognitive trait has evolved remains unanswered. The motor theory for the origin of vocal learning posits that neural centres specialized for vocal learning arose from adjacent areas in the brain devoted to general motor learning. One prediction of this hypothesis is that visual displays that rely on complex motor patterns may also be learned in taxa with vocal learning. While learning of both spoken and gestural languages is well documented in humans, the occurrence of learned visual displays has rarely been examined in non-human animals. We tested for geographical variation consistent with learning of visual displays in long-billed hermits (Phaethornis longirostris), a lek-mating hummingbird that, like humans, has both learned vocalizations and elaborate visual displays. We found lek-level signatures in both vocal parameters and visual display features, including display element proportions, sequence syntax and fine-scale parameters of elements. This variation was not associated with genetic differentiation between leks. In the absence of genetic differences, geographical variation in vocal signals at small scales is most parsimoniously attributed to learning, suggesting a significant role of social learning in visual display ontogeny. The co-occurrence of learning in vocal and visual displays would be consistent with a parallel evolution of these two signal modalities in this species.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

22445100;wos238;Comparing communicative competence in child and chimp - The pragmatics of repetition;"Greenfield P M; Savage-Rumbaugh E S";Journal Article;"Through an analysis of chimpanzee-human discourse, we show that two Pan troglodytes chimpanzees and two Pan paniscus chimpanzees (bonobos) exposed to a humanly devised symbol system use partial or complete repetition of others' symbols, as children do: they do not produce rote imitations, but instead use repetition to fulfil a variety of pragmatic functions in discourse. These functions include agreement, request, promise, excitement, and selection from alternatives. In so doing, the chimpanzees demonstrate contingent turn-taking and the use of simple devices for lexical cohesion. In short, they demonstrate conversational competence. Because of the presence of this conversational competence in three sibling species, chimpanzees, bonobos, and humans, it is concluded that the potential to express pragmatic functions through repetition was part of the evolutionary history of human language, present in our common ancestor before the phylogenetic divergence of hominids and chimpanzees. In the context of these similarities, two interesting differences appeared: (I) Human children sometimes used repetition to stimulate more talk in their conversational partner; the chimpanzees, in contrast, use repetition exclusively to forward the non-verbal action. This difference may illuminate a unique feature of human linguistic communication, or it may simply reflect a modality difference (visual symbols used by the chimpanzees, speech used by the children) in the symbol systems considered in this research. A second difference seems likely to reflect a true species difference: utterance length. The one- and two-symbol repetitions used by the chimpanzees to fulfil a variety of pragmatic functions were less than half the maximum length found in either the visual symbol combinations addressed to them by their adult human caregivers or the oral repetitions of two-year-old children. This species difference probably reflects the evolution of increased brain size and consequent increased memory capacity that has occurred since the phylogenetic divergence of hominids and chimpanzees four to seven million years ago.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23080876;wos239;Rigid head motion in expressive speech animation: Analysis and synthesis;"Busso C; Deng Z; Grimm M; Neumann U; Narayanan S";Journal Article;Rigid head motion is a gesture that conveys important nonverbal information in human communication, and hence it needs to be appropriately modeled and included in realistic facial animations to effectively mimic human behaviors. In this paper, head motion sequences in expressive facial animations are analyzed in terms of their naturalness and emotional salience in perception. Statistical measures are derived from an audiovisual database, comprising synchronized facial gestures and speech, which revealed characteristic patterns in emotional head motion sequences. Head motion patterns with neutral speech significantly differ from head motion patterns with emotional speech in motion activation, range, and velocity. The results show that head motion provides discriminating information about emotional categories. An approach to synthesize emotional head motion sequences driven by prosodic features is presented, expanding upon our previous framework on head motion synthesis. This method naturally models the specific temporal dynamics of emotional head motion sequences by building hidden Markov models for each emotional category (sadness, happiness, anger, and neutral state). Human raters were asked to assess the naturalness and the emotional content of the facial animations. On average, the synthesized head motion sequences were perceived even more natural than the original head motion sequences. The results also show that head motion modifies the emotional perception of the facial animation especially in the valence and activation domain. These results suggest that appropriate. head motion not only significantly improves the naturalness of the animation but can also be used to enhance the emotional content of the animation to effectively engage the users.;Included;Excluded;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the scope of studies on multimodal interaction in aphasia is generally restricted to one or two multimodal resources, and the type of discourse analysed is often not representative of authentic interaction. Finally, the interpersonal (versus referential) functions of multimodal resources are frequently overlooked. Aims: The purpose of this study was to explore the multimodal realisation of enactments by people with aphasia in everyday interaction. Methods & Procedures: Authentic interactions of six people with aphasia interacting with communication partners of their choice were systematically analysed. Frameworks originating from non-brain-damaged studies were applied to examine the characteristics and functions of linguistic, multimodal, and stance-taking resources used to realise enactments. Outcomes & Results: Even though the participants used the same multimodal resources as non-brain-damaged communicators, the frequencies and characteristics were different. The relationship between multimodal resources and interpersonal functions was different as well. Conclusions: People with aphasia use the same multimodal resources as non-brain-damaged communicators, indicating their retained strengths. However, their higher use of intonation, gesture, and - to a lesser extent - facial expression indicates that these may be important 'meaning making' resources for them, which could be utilised more in therapeutic endeavours.;Excluded;NA;Neuro-atypical subjects;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Clinical data suggest that the basal ganglia provide a platform for the integration of primate-general mechanisms of acoustic communication with the faculty of articulate speech in humans. Furthermore, neurobiological and paleoanthropological data point at a two-stage model of the phylogenetic evolution of this crucial prerequisite of spoken language: (i) monosynaptic refinement of the projections of motor cortex to the brainstem nuclei that steer laryngeal muscles, presumably, as part of a 'phylogenetic trend' associated with increasing brain size during hominin evolution; (ii) subsequent vocal-laryngeal elaboration of cortico-basal ganglia circuitries, driven by human-specific FOXP2 mutations.;>This concept implies vocal continuity of spoken language evolution at the motor level, elucidating the deep entrenchment of articulate speech into a 'nonverbal matrix' (Ingold 1994), which is not accounted for by gestural-origin theories. Moreover, it provides a solution to the question for the adaptive value of the 'first word' (Bickerton 2009) since even the earliest and most simple verbal utterances must have increased the versatility of vocal displays afforded by the preceding elaboration of monosynaptic corticobulbar tracts, giving rise to enhanced social cooperation and prestige. At the ontogenetic level, the proposed model assumes age-dependent interactions between the basal ganglia and their cortical targets, similar to vocal learning in some songbirds. In this view, the emergence of articulate speech builds on the 'renaissance' of an ancient organizational principle and, hence, may represent an example of 'evolutionary tinkering' (Jacob 1977).";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although this unusual communicative ability seems to have evolved during domestication [6, 8], it is unclear whether this evolution occurred as a result of direct selection for this ability, as previously hypothesized [8], or as a correlated by-product of selection against fear and aggression toward humans [9]-as is the case with a number of morphological and physiological changes associated with domestication [11-18]. We show here that fox kits from an experimental population selectively bred over 45 years to approach humans fearlessly and nonaggressively (i.e., experimentally domesticated) are not only as skillful as dog puppies in using human gestures but are also more skilled than fox kits from a second, control population not bred for tame behavior (critically, neither population of foxes was ever bred or tested for their ability to use human gestures) [11, 12]. These results suggest that sociocognitive evolution has occurred in the experimental foxes, and possibly domestic dogs, as a correlated by-product of selection on systems mediating fear and aggression, and it is likely the observed social cognitive evolution did not require direct selection for improved social cognitive ability.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23080857;wos249;The development and flexibility of gaze alternations in bonobos and chimpanzees;"Lucca K; MacLean E L; Hare B";Journal Article;Infants' early gaze alternations are one of their first steps towards a sophisticated understanding of the social world. This ability, to gaze alternate between an object of interest and another individual also attending to that object, has been considered foundational to the development of many complex social-cognitive abilities, such as theory of mind and language. However, to understand the evolution of these abilities, it is important to identify whether and how gaze alternations are used and develop in our closest living relatives, bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Here, we evaluated the development of gaze alternations in a large, developmental sample of bonobos (N = 17) and chimpanzees (N = 35). To assess the flexibility of ape gaze alternations, we tested whether they produced gaze alternations when requesting food from a human who was either visually attentive or visually inattentive. Similarly to human infants, both bonobos and chimpanzees produced gaze alternations, and did so more frequently when a human communicative partner was visually attentive. However, unlike humans, who gaze alternate frequently from early in development, chimpanzees did not begin to gaze alternate frequently until adulthood. Bonobos produced very few gaze alternations, regardless of age. Thus, it may be the early emergence of gaze alternations, as opposed gaze alternations themselves, that is derived in the human lineage. The distinctively early emergence of gaze alternations in humans may be a critical underpinning for the development of complex human social-cognitive abilities.;Included;Excluded;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23080844;wos250;Breed differences in domestic dogs' (Canis familiaris) comprehension of human communicative signals;"Wobber V; Hare B; Koler-Matznick J; Wrangham R; Tomasello M";Journal Article;Recent research suggests that some human-like social skills evolved in dogs (Canis familiaris) during domestication as an incidental by-product of selection for 'tame' forms of behavior. It is still possible, however, that the social skills of certain dog breeds came under direct selection that led to further increases in social problem solving ability. To test this hypothesis, different breeds of domestic dogs were compared for their ability to use various human communicative behaviors to find hidden food. We found that even primitive breeds with little human contact were able to use communicative cues. Further, 'working' dogs (shepherds and huskies: thought to be bred intentionally to respond to human cooperative communicative signals) were more skilled at using gestural cues than were non-working breeds (basenji and toy poodles: not thought to have been bred for their cooperative-communicative ability). This difference in performance existed regardless of whether the working breeds were more or less genetically wolf-like. These results suggest that subsequent to initial domesticating selection giving rise to cue-following skills, additional selection on communicative abilities in certain breeds has produced substantive differences in those breeds' abilities to follow cues.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

IQ test data support the notion that language is more bilaterally represented in females than in males. Test data also suggest that females matures faster than males. The factorial pattern of females' IQ, which shows bilateral representation, remains the same throughout life, but the pattern of males' IQ changes from bilateral representation at early childhood to unilateral representation at adolescence and after. Females seeking partners evolved vocal language for emotional and affective communication. Neotenic males were exposed to the vocal language transmitted from nursing females. Vocal language announced from the vocal organ located at the median line was originally bilateral. Gestural language, which is announced from unilateral upper extremities, is another origin of language evolution. Use of hands and arms as language produced 'Name Relation' and 'Truth Value' through matching between object and hand. The hands are under contra hemispheric unilateral control of the brain.

These include a set of size-shape specifiers that co-occur with presumed nominal signs, an iconic contrast between different sign formational elements that somewhat inconsistently signal a noun/verb distinction, and, perhaps most interestingly, a construction involving a clearly grammaticalized locative or copular element that allows Z signers to make clear that they are referring to (physical) objects rather than actions. The paper concludes by considering the overall effect of these quite different formal strategies on the evolving language structure.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We go on to emphasize the necessity of self-experience in psychoanalytic techniques that make use of non-verbal means of communication, such as body feeling and creative activity. Finally, self-experience of the therapist's communication via facial expressions and gestures is recommended, as is social-psychological/group-dynamic self-experience in specially designed training courses. The narrow practice of psychoanalysis/psychotherapy, concentrating as it does on the traditional long-term, high-frequency process, urgently needs to be broadened by the introduction or emphasis of these modifications, which should form a more important part of training programs than has hitherto been the case.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They are concretized here as percussive (noise / sound and rhythm) and vocal ('Vokalisches') (tone). Through the omnipresent rhythm in nature, dance plays a key role. The two basic arts, i.e. art of dancing (Tanzkunst) and word art poetry (Wortkunst), are based on the everyday languages of gesture ('sign') and word ('verbal') language. Their common phylo- and ontogenetic origin is the multimodal 'mimetic action'. They become art in and through the 'Mimetic Ceremony', genuinely the 'Gesamtkunstwerk', tendentially with elements of all senses, originally practiced by all participants in the 'Other State', which is separated from the prosaic 'Normal State' of everyday life by functional and structural distance. The poetry comes, systematically seen, only late into the music, as setting texts to music in vocal music and as texting (troping) into the instrumental music. The verbal text can be dissolved by vocalises (e.g. scat singing) or dadaistic deformations, or by 'de-texting' the transformation of vocal music into instrumental music into latency. One conclusion is the formula: Dance art + word art = sound art.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1993 Society-for-ElectroAcoustic-Music-in-the-United-States Annual Meeting
An approach to composition and the granular synthesis techniques used to create several works will be discussed here. Three instruments for stochastic granular synthesis have been written in the Cmix programming language. The contents of the grains are either synthesized waveforms, or sampled sound files. A NeXT graphical interface to the Cmix instruments, StochGran, currently allows the composer to manipulate graphical envelopes to control grain timing, frequency, and location parameters over time. Control over several parameters in a coordinated relationship is facilitated by the graphical display. The use of the Cmix instruments and interface in composing several works for tape is described. Real time granular synthesis is also explored using the MAX language on the IRCAM Signal Processing Workstation. The work ''Evolutions,'' for eight instruments and computer, uses a combination of Cmix and MAX signal processing. The consequences of these techniques for composition and performance involve differences in composition for and perception of the computer and acoustic parts, the interaction between the computer and instruments, ''musicality,'' timbral shaping into gestures, and philosophical implications of the techniques.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This article approaches the modernizing aspects of Orthodox dispersion from their foundationally mediating locus in holy parts, and more specifically in relics and their technical continuities and discontinuities. Entering into the communicative exhibition of St. Marina's right hand in Egypt, it studies the practical extensions of remembering martyrs across space and time. Relic technics via sensory techniques and cinematic technologies create the very special living properties and metamorphic effects of divine imagination.

22444920;wos258;Understanding visual access in common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus: perspective taking or behaviour reading?;"Burkart J M; Heschl A";Journal Article;We tested common marmosets' understanding of visual access in a series of experiments. In experiment 1, we investigated whether marmosets know what conspecifics do and do not see, using a food competition paradigm originally developed for chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes. Subordinate marmosets consistently chose a piece of food only visible to them and not one that was visible to a dominant competitor as well, indicating a simple mentalistic understanding of visual access (level-1 perspective taking). In experiment 2, we aimed to validate these results by using a different experimental approach, building on the marmosets' ability to use gaze as a cue. Although the marmosets precisely extrapolated gaze direction, no understanding of visual access could be found in this task. In experiment 3, we tested an alternative mechanism to account for the positive outcome in experiment 1. The results suggested that the marmosets had a predisposition to treat a piece of food that was looked at by another individual as belonging to that individual and to avoid it. The marmosets overall showed high proficiency in exactly extrapolating gaze direction but failed to show consistent and context-independent perspective-taking abilities. The findings are discussed with regard to results from other primate species and, from a broader evolutionary perspective, with regard to their implications for the emergence of sophisticated forms of gaze understanding in humans.

The Gardners' work with the chimpanzee Washoe, Premack's study of the chimpanzee Sarah, and continuing experiments along these lines indicate that neural restructuring would not have been necessary for the protohominid acquisition of a simple propositional gesture or sign language which did not involve cross-modal transfer at a high level from the visual to the auditory channel or vice versa.  Evidence from primate studies, early tool-using, the continuing functions of gesture in human communication, lateral dominance in its relation to speech and tool manipulation, and other sources is presented to support a model of glottogenesis.

Here, we report the first systematic analysis of gesture in a population of wild chimpanzees. Over 266 days of observation, we recorded 4,397 cases of intentional gesture use in the Sonso community, Budongo, Uganda. We describe 66 distinct gesture types: this estimate appears close to asymptote, and the Sonso repertoire includes most gestures described informally at other sites. Differences in repertoire were noted between individuals and age classes, but in both cases, the measured repertoire size was predicted by the time subjects were observed gesturing. No idiosyncratic usages were found, i.e. no gesture type was used only by one individual. No support was found for the idea that gestures are acquired by 'ontogenetic ritualization' from originally effective actions; moreover, in detailed analyses of two gestures, action elements composing the gestures did not closely match those of the presumed original actions. Rather, chimpanzee gestures are species-typical; indeed, many are 'family-typical', because gesture types recorded in gorillas, orangutans and chimpanzee overlap extensively, with 24 gestures recorded in all three genera. Nevertheless, chimpanzee gestures are used flexibly across a range of contexts and show clear adjustment to audience (e.g. silent gestures for attentive targets, contact gestures for inattentive ones). Such highly intentional use of a species-typical repertoire raises intriguing questions for the evolution of advanced communication.";Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Researchers have recently catalogued the meanings of chimpanzee gestures, but little is known about the gesture meanings of our other closest living relative, the bonobo. The bonobo gestural repertoire overlaps by approximately 90% with that of the chimpanzee, but such overlap might not extend to meanings. Here, we first determine the meanings of bonobo gestures by analysing the outcomes of gesturing that apparently satisfy the signaller. Around half of bonobo gestures have a single meaning, while half are more ambiguous. Moreover, all but 1 gesture type have distinct meanings, achieving a different distribution of intended meanings to the average distribution for all gesture types. We then employ a randomisation procedure in a novel way to test the likelihood that the observed between-species overlap in the assignment of meanings to gestures would arise by chance under a set of different constraints. We compare a matrix of the meanings of bonobo gestures with a matrix for those of chimpanzees against 10,000 randomised iterations of matrices constrained to the original data at 4 different levels. We find that the similarity between the 2 species is much greater than would be expected by chance.

Method: This study probes the characteristics of the dominant hemisphere by overloading cognitive processing via a novel dual-task paradigm. In 2 experiments, participants performed sets of motor and speech tasks under single-task and dual-task conditions. The sets of tasks differed as to the extent to which they relied on sequential processing, and we hypothesized that tasks more reliant on this type of processing would suffer a greater performance decrement under dual-task conditions. A reliable measure of hemispheric language dominance was obtained via functional transcranial Doppler (fTCD) ultrasound. Results: Speech production scores in the experimental set (i.e., sequential processing) were consistently impaired under dual-task conditions, a distinction that was not seen in the control set. Results of Experiment 2 confirm those of Experiment 1, whereby speech scores were most strongly impaired under dual-task conditions, especially in the experimental set. Motor performance suffered less than speech performance in dual-task conditions in both the experimental and control sets across both experiments. Conclusion: Data suggest that the common processing capacity for speech and fine motor praxis can be disrupted through a dual-task paradigm. This novel behavioral data supports theories of a motor-based gestural origin for language and indicates that speech production is more sensitive to the effects of increased processing requirements than are motor skills.";Included;Excluded;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445541;wos264;The origin of human multi-modal communication;"Levinson S C; Holler J";Journal Article;One reason for the apparent gulf between animal and human communication systems is that the focus has been on the presence or the absence of language as a complex expressive system built on speech. But language normally occurs embedded within an interactional exchange of multi-modal signals. If this larger perspective takes central focus, then it becomes apparent that human communication has a layered structure, where the layers may be plausibly assigned different phylogenetic and evolutionary origins-especially in the light of recent thoughts on the emergence of voluntary breathing and spoken language. This perspective helps us to appreciate the different roles that the different modalities play in human communication, as well as how they function as one integrated system despite their different roles and origins. It also offers possibilities for reconciling the 'gesture-first hypothesis' with that of gesture and speech having evolved together, hand in hand-or hand in mouth, rather-as one system.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here, we examined whether bonobos and chimpanzee differ in selected brain regions that may map to these different social and cognitive abilities. Eight chimpanzees and eight bonobos matched on age, sex and rearing experiences were magnetic resonance images scanned and volumetric measures were obtained for the whole brain, cerebellum, striatum, motor-hand area, hippocampus, inferior frontal gyrus and planum temporale. Chimpanzees had significantly larger cerebellum and borderline significantly larger hippocampus and putamen, after adjusting for brain size, compared with bonobos. Bonobos showed greater leftward asymmetries in the striatum and motor-hand area compared with chimpanzees. No significant differences in either the volume or lateralization for the so-called language homologs were found between species. The results suggest that the two species of Pan are quite similar neurologically, though some volumetric and lateralized differences may reflect inherent differences in social organization, cognition and motor skills.

In the present study, we examined (i) hand preference for a communicative gesture (clapping in 94 captive chimpanzees from two research facilities) and (ii) the in vivo magnetic resonance imaging brain scans of 40 of these individuals. The preferred hand for clapping was defined as the one in the upper position when the two hands came together. Using computer manual tracing of regions of interest, we measured the neuroanatomical asymmetries for the homologues of key language areas, including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and planum temporale (PT). When considering the entire sample, there was a predominance of right-handedness for clapping and the distribution of right-and left-handed individuals did not differ between the two facilities. The direction of hand preference (right-versus left-handed subjects) for clapping explained a significant portion of variability in asymmetries of the PT and IFG.

22445424;wos269;Chimpanzee Vocal Signaling Points to a Multimodal Origin of Human Language;"Taglialatela J P; Russell J L; Schaeffer J A; Hopkins W D";Journal Article;The evolutionary origin of human language and its neurobiological foundations has long been the object of intense scientific debate. Although a number of theories have been proposed, one particularly contentious model suggests that human language evolved from a manual gestural communication system in a common ape-human ancestor. Consistent with a gestural origins theory are data indicating that chimpanzees intentionally and referentially communicate via manual gestures, and the production of manual gestures, in conjunction with vocalizations, activates the chimpanzee Broca's area homologue - a region in the human brain that is critical for the planning and execution of language. However, it is not known if this activity observed in the chimpanzee Broca's area is the result of the chimpanzees producing manual communicative gestures, communicative sounds, or both. This information is critical for evaluating the theory that human language evolved from a strictly manual gestural system. To this end, we used positron emission tomography ( PET) to examine the neural metabolic activity in the chimpanzee brain. We collected PET data in 4 subjects, all of whom produced manual communicative gestures. However, 2 of these subjects also produced so-called attention-getting vocalizations directed towards a human experimenter. Interestingly, only the two subjects that produced these attention-getting sounds showed greater mean metabolic activity in the Broca's area homologue as compared to a baseline scan. The two subjects that did not produce attention-getting sounds did not. These data contradict an exclusive 'gestural origins'' theory for they suggest that it is vocal signaling that selectively activates the Broca's area homologue in chimpanzees. In other words, the activity observed in the Broca's area homologue reflects the production of vocal signals by the chimpanzees, suggesting thast this critical human language region was involved in vocal signaling in the common ancestor of both modern humans and chimpanzees.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445548;wos270;The role of socio-communicative rearing environments in the development of social and physical cognition in apes;"Russell J L; Lyn H; Schaeffer J A; Hopkins W D ";Journal Article;The cultural intelligence hypothesis (CIH) claims that humans advanced cognition is a direct result of human culture and that children are uniquely specialized to absorb and utilize this cultural experience (Tomasello, 2000). Comparative data demonstrating that 2.5-year-old human children outperform apes on measures of social cognition but not on measures of physical cognition support this claim (Herrmann et similar to al., 2007). However, the previous study failed to control for rearing when comparing these two species. Specifically, the human children were raised in a human culture whereas the apes were raised in standard sanctuary settings. To further explore the CIH, here we compared the performance on multiple measures of social and physical cognition in a group of standard reared apes raised in conditions typical of zoo and biomedical laboratory settings to that of apes reared in an enculturated socio-communicatively rich environment. Overall, the enculturated apes significantly outperformed their standard reared counterparts on the cognitive tasks and this was particularly true for measures of communication. Furthermore, the performance of the enculturated apes was very similar to previously reported data from 2.5-year-old children. We conclude that apes who are reared in a human-like socio-communicatively rich environment develop superior communicative abilities compared to apes reared in standard laboratory settings, which supports some assumptions of the cultural intelligence hypothesis.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We examined contextual elements of the use of two of these vocal signals, the 'raspberry' and the extended grunt. Our results demonstrate that these vocalizations are not elicited by the presence of food, but instead function as attention-getting signals. These findings reveal a heretofore underappreciated category of animal signals: attention-getting sounds produced in novel environmental circumstances. The invention and use of species-atypical signals, considered in relation to group differences in signalling repertoires in apes in their natural habitats, may index a generative capacity in these hominoid species without obvious corollary in other primate species.

Anatomically, Broca's area is most often larger in the left hemisphere, and functional imaging studies in humans indicate significant left-lateralized patterns of activation during language-related tasks [1-3]. If, and to what extent, nonhuman primates, particularly chimpanzees, possess a homologous region that is involved in the production of their own communicative signals remains unknown. Here, we show that portions of the IFG as well as other cortical and subcortical regions in chimpanzees are active during the production of communicative signals. These findings are the first to provide direct evidence of the neuroanatomical structures associated with the production of communicative behaviors in chimpanzees. Significant activation in the left IFG in conjunction with other cortical and subcortical brain areas during the production of communicative signals in chimpanzees suggests that the neurological substrates underlying language production in the human brain may have been present in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the present paper we aim to reconcile both approaches in one single perspective that is informed by a recent sea change in cognitive science, namely, Predictive Processing Perspectives (PPP; Clark 2013b; 2015). We start with the idea put forth by the Gesture as Simulated Action (GSA) framework (Hostetter, Alibali 2008). Under this view, the mental processes that give rise to gesture are re-enactments of sensori-motor experiences (i.e., simulated actions). We show that such anticipatory sensori-motor states and the constraints put forth by the GSA framework can be understood as top-down kinesthetic predictions that function in a broader predictive machinery as proposed by PPP.

It takes a critical perspective towards multimodality and proposes the simultaneous emphasis on critical and multimodal literacies.
Design/methodology/approach - This qualitative teacher-inquiry adopts critical multimodal literacy as the framework for understanding learners' literacy practices. The course implementation highlights images, sounds and words as encompassing the five modes of visual, aural, linguistic, gestural and spatial (Arola et al., 2014) in emphasizing the multimodal in critical multimodal literacy, and the purposeful organization of the images, sounds and words as reflecting the critical in critical multimodal literacy. The analysis also adopts Serafini's (2010) concentric perceptual, structural and ideological perspectives as the tenets of critical multimodal literacy.
Findings - The findings show that focusing on images, sounds, words and their purposeful organization enabled the students to critically examine a moving-image text through considerations for the multiple modes and arriving at the structural and ideological interpretive perspectives.
Originality/value - This study fills a gap in the literature, as very little research has been done to investigate the ways in which language learners engage with, that is, comprehend and interpret, movingimage multimodal texts.

Taking off from the late nineteenth century, the essay covers Shakespearean texts translated into some major Philippine languages-Tagalog, Kapampangan, Hiligaynon, and Bikolano-over the course of the twentieth century. The essay attempts to locate and describe some key qualities of Shakespearean translations in Philippine literatures, account for the shifting nature of authorship in these local practices of translation, and finally gestures towards probing the question of motivation-why was Shakespearean translation, an activity unsanctioned by colonial governments, pursued anyway?



Read against the backdrop of colonial education and the cosmopolitan nature of Philippine translations of foreign texts, these local versions of Shakespeare display a variety of strategies of cultural accommodation that bespeak a striving towards a reconciliation of the original foreign source with the local culture and the biases and expectations of its readers and audiences. They represent a practice of translation that aspires to reconciliation rather than reproduction, laying bare a process of meaning making in a cross-cultural encounter that actively produces a Filipino Shakespeare rather than merely reproducing the English Shakespeare in a Philippine language.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The informational coding economy of human languages is often demonstrated by their almost universal fit to Zipf's 'Law of Brevity,' expressing negative relationship between word length and its usage frequency. Animal vocal systems, however, provided mixed results in their adherence to this relationship, potentially due to conflicting evolutionary pressures related to differences in signaling range and communicational needs. To examine this potential parallel between human and animal vocal communication, and also to explore how divergent, sex-specific, communicational settings affect signaling efficiency within a species, we examined the complete vocal repertoire of rock hyraxes (Procavia capensis). As male and female hyraxes differ in their sociality levels and male hyraxes vocal repertoire is dominated by sexual advertisement songs, we hypothesized that sex-specific vocal repertoires could be subjected to different signaling optimization pressures. Our results show that the sexes differ in repertoire size, call usage, and adherence to coding efficiency principles. Interestingly, the classic call length/call usage relationship is not consistently found in rock hyraxes. Rather, a negative relationship between call amplitude and call usage is found, suggesting that the efficiency of the vocal repertoire is driven by call amplitude rather than duration. We hypothesize that, in contrast to human speech that is mainly intended for short distance, the need for frequent long-range signaling shapes an animal's vocal repertoire efficiency according to the cost of call amplitude rather than call length. However, call duration may be a secondary factor affecting signaling efficiency, in cases where amplitude is under specific selection pressures, such as sexual selection.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444900;wos281;Relationship between manual preferences for object manipulation and pointing gestures in infants and toddlers;"Imbault J; Vauclair J";Journal Article;The aim of this study was to measure the pattern of hand preferences for pointing gestures as a function of object-manipulation handedness in 123 infants and toddlers (10-40 months). The results showed that not only right-handers but also left-handers and ambidextrous participants tended to use their right hand for pointing. There was a significant correlation between manual preferences and pointing lateralization. Further analyses showed that the correlation between these two indexes was at its strongest during two key phases of language development (i.e. vocabulary spurt and syntax improvement) and weakened to become nonsignificant in the interim. These findings support the view that humans have a specialized area for communicative gestures and language in the left cerebral hemisphere that may be independent of the system controlling the purely motor functions of hand use.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445194;wos282;Method and Evidence: Gesture and Iconicity in the Evolution of Language;Irvine E;Journal Article;The aim of this article is to mount a challenge to gesture-first hypotheses about the evolution of language by identifying constraints on the emergence of symbol use. Current debates focus on a range of pre-conditions for the emergence of language, including co-operation and related mentalising capacities, imitation and tool use, episodic memory, and vocal physiology, but little specifically on the ability to learn and understand symbols. It is argued here that such a focus raises new questions about the plausibility of gesture-first hypotheses, and so about the evolution of language in general. After a brief review of the methodology used in the article, it is argued that existing uses of gesture in hominid communities may have prohibited the emergence of symbol use, rather than bootstrapped' symbolic capacities as is usually assumed, and that the vocal channel offers other advantages in both learning and using language. In this case, the vocal channel offers a more promising platform for the evolution of language than is often assumed.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444974;wos283;Language Origins Viewed in Spontaneous and Interactive Vocal Rates of Human and Bonobo Infants;"Oller D K; Griebel U; Iyer S N; Jhang Y; Warlaumont A S; Dale R; Call J ";Journal Article;From the first months of life, human infants produce 'protophones,' speech-like, non-cry sounds, presumed absent, or only minimally present in other apes. But there have been no direct quantitative comparisons to support this presumption. In addition, by 2 months, human infants show sustained face-to-face interaction using protophones, a pattern thought also absent or very limited in other apes, but again, without quantitative comparison. Such comparison should provide evidence relevant to determining foundations of language, since substantially flexible vocalization, the inclination to explore vocalization, and the ability to interact socially by means of vocalization are foundations for language. Here we quantitatively compare data on vocalization rates in three captive bonobo (Pan paniscus) mother-infant pairs with various sources of data from our laboratories on human infant vocalization. Both humans and bonobos produced distress sounds (cries/screams) and laughter. The bonobo infants also produced sounds that were neither screams nor laughs and that showed acoustic similarities to the human protophones. These protophone-like sounds confirm that bonobo infants share with humans the capacity to produce vocalizations that appear foundational for language. Still, there were dramatic differences between the species in both quantity and function of the protophone and protophone-like sounds. The bonobo protophone-like sounds were far less frequent than the human protophones, and the human protophones were far less likely to be interpreted as complaints and more likely as vocal play. Moreover, we found extensive vocal interaction between human infants and mothers, but no vocal interaction in the bonobo mother-infant pairs-while bonobo mothers were physically responsive to their infants, we observed no case of a bonobo mother vocalization directed to her infant. Our cross-species comparison focuses on low- and moderate-arousal circumstances because we reason the roots of language entail vocalization not triggered by excitement, for example, during fighting or intense play. Language appears to be founded in flexible vocalization, used to regulate comfortable social interaction, to share variable affective states at various levels of arousal, and to explore vocalization itself.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the technology advancement, motion capture has been widely used in MA to capture and evaluate human performance. However, methods to create motion templates (templates) of MA techniques from scratch are rarely exposed because there is no complete evaluation system framework suggested for MA. This paper presents in detaile how to create the MA templates using framework of extrinsic feedback-based evaluation system generally and R-GDL specifically. To create more robust templates, GDL has been used in validation tests. SSCM becomes the case study in this research. The main contribution in this paper is introduction of new datasets of templates for SSCM techniques. Evaluation of trainees' performance will be done using the datasets for future works.

22445525;wos288;Solidarity and care as relational practices;Jennings B;Journal Article;"But he's a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid. He's not to be allowed to fall into his grave like an old dog. Attention, attention must be finally paid to such a person. Arthur Miller Work in the fields of bioethics and public health ethics over several decades has been theoretically diverse, but particular styles of theorizing, let alone individual theories, do have distinctive philosophical assumptions and discursive characteristics. For example, in the domain of clinical bioethics a strong emphasis has been given to respect for autonomous will-formation by individuals in medical decisions and behavioral choices directly affecting them. In the domain of public health ethics and policy bioethics, where debates over issues such as health access and financing and over mandatory vaccination policies are ongoing, there is a clash between an individualistic understanding of rights, liberty, and privacy, on the one hand, and a communitarian understanding of the common good and the health and well-being of society as a whole, on the other. Cutting across this spectrum of individualism and holism, there is another discernable array of approaches to theorizing and concept formation in bioethics. Two in particular are pertinent to this article. One may be called an 'applied' mode of bioethics, which is focused on applying moral principles and rules to specific situations of action and choice. A contrasting 'relational' mode of bioethics seeks to present normative interpretations of historically embedded patterns of agency, interdependency, and institutional structures of power. To be sure, many specific works of bioethics utilize both an applied and a relational approach, but I believe that this distinction is heuristically useful. It can alert us to the fact that seemingly univocal concepts, such as autonomy, justice, equality, dignity, and personhood, carry a different meaning when they are theorized as principles to be applied from when they are theorized as practices to be interpreted. In this article my aim is to advance the discussion of relational approaches within bioethics by an interpretive analysis of the concept of solidarity and the concept of care when seen as modes of moral and political practice. I single out solidarity for this discussion because the range of moral questions traditionally associated with the concept are normatively integral to many key issues with which health policy and public health must deal-such as just access to healthcare, civic and financial support for social insurance and social welfare policies, and the intergenerational justice issues that bedevil the transition to an aging society and the mitigation of global climate change. In bioethics and public health ethics today, solidarity should be taken seriously and not dismissed as an obsolete idea from a bygone political era, and a recent surge of interest in the concept attests to this. On the other hand, care is an extremely influential normative concept in bioethics and has been for several decades. But the praxis and institutional support for care, no less than those of solidarity, are vulnerable in the current ideological climate and need to be supported discursively and politically. The practices of care are also essential to the core problems with which health policy and public health must grapple.



I believe that solidarity and care offer instructive constitutive contexts within which the moral identity of persons is grounded and articulated in recognition, affirming the moral standing of those oppressed as equal members of a moral community, and in attention, attesting to the moral presence and considerability of those vulnerable and in need. Solidarity constitutes just affirmation of the other as subject, not merely object; care constitutes just attention to the other in a cognate way as subject, not object. This recognition of, and attention paid to, persons as moral subjects, in turn, can politically motivate a society in three respects. The recognition of solidarity and the attention of care can prompt progressive change toward a democratic willingness: (a) to provide for equal respect for rights and dignity; (b) to provide the social resources and services needed for just health and well-being; and (c) to focus its creativity and wealth on the actualization of potential flourishing of each and all. As Carol Gould observes concerning solidarity on this score: 'the proliferation of solidarity relations that establish commonalities across differences, along with the linkages that develop among individuals and groups within solidarity movements, help to construct more universalistic conceptions of our obligations to each other.' Though much has been written on the protean concepts of solidarity and care, much still remains to be seen and said, for their ethical meaning and political significance change as they develop and manifest themselves in action over time. My discussion explores how persons and groups are recognized within the practices of solidarity and care; what stance or posture persons and groups take toward one another; and how their standing as free and equal members of a moral community is constituted and sustained by these practices. The guiding thread is right recognition of the full ethical standing of other human beings as subjects rather than as objects. Just recognition of moral standing and moral attention in solidarity and care is my explicit focus, finding the moral imagination and political will to sustain them, my background theme. Relational bioethics is a conceptually dynamic and rather eclectic field today, frequently drawing on paradigm-shifting work in moral and political philosophy and on conceptual innovations ongoing in the humanities and the social sciences, including feminist theories, critical theories of various kinds, and orientations informed by philosophical pragmatism and hermeneutics, among others. Inspired by several cognate modes of critical discourse, relational theorizing has turned away from both methodological and ethical individualism. Often, it is more concerned with diachronic (streaming over time) social practices than with synchronic (snapshot in time) individual acts. It favors what Margaret Urban Walker has called the 'expressive-collaborative' model of morality over the 'theoretical-juridical' model. It strives to place the agency of individuals within a constitutive context of meaning and interdependence. This context includes both dyadic and small group transactions among persons in direct contact and social, structural interdependencies growing out of institutionalized forms of power. Relational theorizing is a space of historical and cultural embeddedness and embodied living in the natural, material world.



Moreover, due to this contextual perspective, relational theorizing and its discourse are reflexive in questioning their own philosophical grounding and epistemic legitimacy, and they are willing to move away from once solid convictions concerning objectivity, impartiality, and rational authority. All theory and praxis, on this view-including bioethics-inevitably reflects some positional perspective, especially when it most strenuously claims not to, and the best that can be done is to sustain a continuing engagement with different values and viewpoints over time. Closure of conflicting interpretations in the public space of question and answer is apt to be provisional and contingent. While chastening, this need not be an epistemological loss. Within such a critical reflexivity, possibilities open up for new ways of thinking about the basic object of study of ethics and for an emphasis on substantive aspects of ethical agency and value that have been relatively neglected heretofore. The object of study in bioethics (or in ethics generally) or in social science is not intuitively given or logically or methodologically determined. Settling on what should be taken as the unit of ethics analysis is the result of an on-going, contested process of interpretation, partly derived from available theoretical concepts, partly from the exercise of experience-based practical judgment. As social theorist Craig Calhoun argues, concerning this contest, we should 'see the process as basic and never ending, and [subject] it to our continuing attention, rather than [imagine] that it is settled once and for all'. When bioethics focuses on relational practices, its designated object of study becomes those patterns and structures of interrelated activity, choice, and the exercise of power in time. These patterns are understood dynamically, as well as diachronically, with emergent properties and functions taking shape contingently rather than deterministically. Dynamic patterns in social life and human action may at times be spontaneous or random. However, when these patterns endure they comprise 'practices', which may be defined as rule-based, value-laden forms of agency and activity in which diverse human capabilities or potentialities are actualized in the social and material worlds. Let us consider the elements of this definition more fully. First, social practices are structured sociologically by roles and relationships involving authority, power, distribution, and exchange. Governments, corporations, and hospitals are examples of institutionalized structures where social practices of various kinds take place. Social practices are also structured normatively by various conceptions of rightness, goodness, and value. Finally, social practices are experienced within lifeworlds of social-cultural meanings, where action-guiding reasons and motivations are formed, culturally mediated self- and group-identities are shaped, and ongoing reinterpretation of roles and relationships takes place. How are social practices so conceived possible and sustainable?

The aims of this study were to investigate within breed variation in human-directed contact seeking in dogs and to estimate its genetic basis. To do this, 498 research beagles, bred and kept under standardized conditions, were tested in an unsolvable problem task. Contact seeking behaviours recorded included both eye contact and physical interactions. Behavioural data was summarized through a principal component analysis, resulting in four components: test interactions, social interactions, eye contact and physical contact. Females scored significantly higher on social interactions and physical contact and age had an effect on eye contact scores. Narrow sense heritabilities (h(2)) of the two largest components were estimated at 0.32 and 0.23 but were not significant for the last two components. These results show that within the studied dog population, behavioural variation in human-directed social behaviours was sex dependent and that the utilization of eye contact seeking increased with age and experience. Hence, heritability estimates indicate a significant genetic contribution to the variation found in human-directed social interactions, suggesting that social skills in dogs have a genetic basis, but can also be shaped and enhanced through individual experiences. This research gives the opportunity to further investigate the genetics behind dogs' social skills, which could also play a significant part into research on human social disorders such as autism.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we present a novel translation system, which can capture human gestures through micro-inertial measurement units (IMUs) and translate the gestures into specific meanings accordingly. Each micro-IMU consists of a 3D accelerometer and gyroscope. A micro-controller and ZigBee network were used to acquire data simultaneously and wirelessly. Ten types of basic Chinese sign language movements including what, how, work, today, happy, please, book, body, clothes and and were collected and stored to form a motion-sensing database. A discrete cosine transform (DCT) was performed to extract the effective features from the original data, while a hidden Markov model (HMM) was used to train the database in order to form an HMM classifier. Testing samples were used to test the HMM classifier. Different sign languages were recognized through the HMM classifier and subsequent translation processes were performed. Experimental results showed that the correct recognition rate ranges from 95% to 100% for the 10 sign language movements, and the overall correction rate is 98%.

22445709;wos293;Student nurses' experiences of communication in cross-cultural care encounters;"Jirwe M; Gerrish K; Emami A";Journal Article;"Background: Communication is a fundamental component of cross-cultural care encounters. Nurses experience communication difficulties in situations where they do not speak the same language as their patients. Communication difficulties are a major obstacle for immigrant patients and can lead to insufficient information and poor quality nursing care in contrast to the majority population.
Aim: To explore student nurses' experiences of communication in cross-cultural care encounters.
Methods: Semi-structured interviews were undertaken a purposive sample of 10 final year students from one university in Sweden: five participants were from a Swedish background and five from an immigrant background. Interviews explored participant's experiences of communication in cross-cultural care encounters. Interviews were tape recorded, transcribed and analysed using 'framework' approach.
Results:Four themes were identified: conceptualizing cross-cultural care encounters, difficulties in communication, communication strategies and factors influencing communication. 'Culture' was equated with country of origin. Cross-cultural care encounters involved patients from a different immigrant background to the nurse. Student nurses experienced particular difficulties communicating with patients with whom they did not share a common language. This led to care becoming mechanistic and impersonal. They were fearful of making mistakes and lacked skills and confidence in questioning patients. Various strategies were used to overcome communication barriers including the use of relatives to interpret, nonverbal communication, gestures and artefacts. Other factors which influenced communication included the student's attitude, cultural knowledge acquired through education and life experience.
Conclusion: Although student nurses seek creative ways to communicate with patients from different cultural backgrounds they lack skills and confidence in cross-cultural communication. Nursing programmes need to address this deficit to ensure that nurses are equipped with the knowledge and skills to provide quality care to patients from different cultural backgrounds.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this Work he asserts that the speaking organs imitated the bodily gestures, especially those of the hands, with which Homo sapiens some 30,000 years ago tried to make himself comprehensible and to understand his neighbours. This theory was put forward first in a treatise on the Polynesian language by Dr. J. Rae in 1862 (reprinted in 'Human Speech'). Sir Richard Paget emphasizes that the natural sign-language of those born deaf, and that of the Red Indians, may give useful information as to the stages by which the human language was developed.

Findings - The findings suggest that the non-verbal cues of frequent speech disruptions, frequent or inappropriate smiles, the avoidance Of eye contact, and increased hand gestures are poor indicators of criminal involvement and are strongly influenced by the race/ethnicity of the individual.

23080871;wos297;School form, teaching work and textual production: New configurations;"Jordao H G; Nonato S";Journal Article;"In order to situate text production practices historically in formal contexts of teaching, we will consider the relations between school form and written language based on two theoretical approaches: i) the reflections made on the origin of the school form, its relations with the written language, and the ways in which a scriptural-scholar relationship of language is established with the knowledge historically constructed by humanity (VINCENT; LAHIRE; THIN, 2001) and (ii) the redesign of the school form from the last decades of the 20th century as a result of the of a new social scenario outlined and of the new ways of thinking the teaching of written production (TARDIF; BORGES, 2009). In order to understand the transformations in the didactic relation of current school practices, we will summon the teaching work theory that shows the ways in which the teacher organizes the interaction of students with knowledge, highlighting as relevant units of analysis the use of didactic instruments and gestures (SCHNEUWLY, 2009). Finally, we will present the data generated in the development of an activity of production of texts in a Laboratory of Educational Informatics of a municipal school. The results point to changes in the way in which the interaction between teachers and students occurs within the development of the activity due to the differentiated spatial organization and the use of interconnected computers.

23080795;wos300;Do dogs get the point? A review of dog-human communication ability;"Kaminski J; Nitzschner M";Journal Article;In recent years evidence has accumulated demonstrating that dogs are, to a degree, skilful in using human forms of communication, making them stand out in the animal kingdom. Neither man's closest relative, the chimpanzee, nor dog's closest living relative, the wolf, can use human communication as flexibly as the domestic dog. This has led to the hypothesis that dogs' skills in this domain may be a result of selection pressures during domestication, which have shaped dogs' skills tremendously. One hypothesis, the so-called by-product hypothesis, suggests that dogs have been selected against fear and aggression and as a by-product this paved the way for the evolution of generally more flexible social cognitive skills, which surpassed those of their ancestor, the wolf. Another hypothesis, the adaptation hypothesis, has claimed that dogs may have been specifically selected for certain tasks for which using human forms of communication was necessary. As of yet, the mechanism underlying dogs' understanding of human forms of communication is not fully understood. We argue here that understanding the mechanism involved will also shed light on possible evolutionary scenarios. We argue that the evidence to date suggests that dogs' understanding of human forms of communication may be more specialized than was predicted by some and may be best explained as the result of a special adaptation of dogs to the specific activities humans have used them for.

One reason for apes' difficulty at comprehending pointing gestures might be that in former studies they were mainly confronted with human declarative pointing gestures, whereas apes have largely been shown to point imperatively and towards humans. In the present study bonobos, chimpanzees and orangutans were confronted with a conspecific's imperative pointing gesture in a competitive context, therefore mirroring former studies that have investigated apes' skills at producing these gestures.
However, apes in the present study did not use their conspecific's pointing gestures. Apes have been shown to use indexical information when provided non-communicatively and to interpret other individuals' actions in terms of motives.

Intentional and referential pointing has been shown previously in humans and apes but not in songbirds, although some avian species show cognitive abilities rivaling those of apes, and their brain structures and functions show putative preconditions for referential gestural signaling (i.e. mirror neurons, links of vocal learning nuclei to discrete brain areas active during limb and body movements). The results reported are based on trials testing predator detection and responses to a taxidermic model of a wedge-tailed eagle by Australian magpies Gymnorhina tibicen. Magpies were subjected to three conditions of finding this model in their territory (open, sheltered and hidden). In the sheltered and hidden conditions, the discoverer simultaneously engaged in alarm calls and beak pointing, a behavior that has not been described previously. Other group members at once assembled and, after watching the first bird, adopted the same posture by pointing to the location of the intruder. The question is whether beak and body movements orienting towards important stimuli or events are instances of arousal, imitation or intentional communication. The latter presupposes that onlookers interpret the signal and respond by altering their own behavior appropriate to the original stimulus and not merely by imitating the first signaler. Evidence presented here indicates that the act of pointing may well be a complex cognitive behavior, i.e., an intentional and referential signal, showing that pointing is not limited to having hands and arms [Current Zoology 57 (4): 453-467, 2011].;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Amy died shortly after a period of observation had ended and the family subsequently consented to the data being shared.
Design/methodology/approach - This individual case study presentation was nested within a larger study conducted in England and Scotland between 2013 and 2014. The overall aim of the main study was to investigate how healthcare professionals and informal carers recognised, assessed and managed pain in patients living with dementia in a range of acute settings.
Findings - The presented case study of Amy raises three critical reflection points: (i) Researcher providing care, i.e. the place and positioning of compassion in research observation; (ii) What do the stories mean? i.e. the reframing of Amy's words, gestures and behaviours as (end of) life review, potentially highlights unresolved personal conflicts and reflections on loss; and (iii) Communication is embodied, i.e. the need to move beyond the recording of words to represent lived experience and into more multi-sensory methods of data capture.

22444897;wos306;Bringing the Nonlinearity of the Movement System to Gestural Theories of Language Use: Multifractal Structure of Spoken English Supports the Compensation for Coarticulation in Human Speech Perception;"Ward R M; Kelty-Stephen D G ";Journal Article;Coarticulation is the tendency for speech vocalization and articulation even at the phonemic level to change with context, and compensation for coarticulation (CfC) reflects the striking human ability to perceive phonemic stability despite this variability. A current controversy centers on whether CfC depends on contrast between formants of a speech-signal spectrogram-specifically, contrast between offset formants concluding context stimuli and onset formants opening the target sound-or on speech-sound variability specific to the coordinative movement of speech articulators (e.g., vocal folds, postural muscles, lips, tongues). This manuscript aims to encode that coordinative-movement context in terms of speech-signal multifractal structure and to determine whether speech's multifractal structure might explain the crucial gestural support for any proposed spectral contrast. We asked human participants to categorize individual target stimuli drawn from an 11-step [ga]-to-[da] continuum as either phonemes 'GA' or 'DA.' Three groups each heard a specific-type context stimulus preceding target stimuli: either real-speech [al] or [ar], sine-wave tones at the third-formant offset frequency of either [al] or [ar], and either simulated-speech contexts [al] or [ar] Here, simulating speech contexts involved randomizing the sequence of relatively homogeneous pitch periods within vowel-sound [a] of each [al] and [ar]. Crucially, simulated-speech contexts had the same offset and extremely similar vowel formants as and, to additional naive participants, sounded identical to real-speech contexts. However, randomization distorted original speech-context multifractality, and effects of spectral contrast following speech only appeared after regression modeling of trial-by-trial 'GA' judgments controlled for context-stimulus multifractality. Furthermore, simulated-speech contexts elicited faster responses (like tone contexts do) and weakened known biases in CfC, suggesting that spectral contrast depends on the nonlinear interactions across multiple scales that articulatory gestures express through the speech signal. Traditional mouse-tracking behaviors measured as participants moved their computer-mouse cursor to register their 'GA'-or-'DA' decisions with mouse-clicks suggest that listening to speech leads the movement system to resonate with the multifractality of context stimuli. We interpret these results as shedding light on a new multifractal terrain upon which to found a better understanding in which movement systems play an important role in shaping how speech perception makes use of acoustic information.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Meeting of the German-Linguistic-Society
In recent discussions there has been a tendency to refer to 'gesture' and 'sign' as if these are distinct categories, sometimes even as if they are in opposition to one another. Here I trace the historical origins of this distinction. I suggest that it is a product of the application to the analysis of sign languages of a formalist model of language derived from structural linguistics, on the one hand, and, on the other, of a cognitive-psychological view of 'gesture' that emerged in the latter half of the twentieth century. I suggest that this division between 'gesture' and 'sign' tends to exaggerate differences and obscure areas of overlap. It should be replaced by a comparative semiotics of the utterance uses of visible bodily action. This will be better able to articulate the similarities and differences between how kinesics is used, according to whether and how it is employed in relation to other communicative modalities such as speech.";Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although nodding and shaking the head are common ways to express these seemingly simple responses, these gestures develop later than others such as pointing. We analyzed diary observations from eight infants to investigate the origins of these gestures, why they develop later than other early gestures, and why nodding the head to indicate yes develops later than shaking the head for no. We found that young infants were able to shake their heads side-to-side, but they did not use this movement to communicate refusals at first. Infants had difficulty learning the nodding movement, but they could perform the physical movement before using it to communicate yes. These gestures developed along different trajectories with shaking the head for no emerging between 13 and 15 months and nodding for yes between 16 and 18 months.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the present study, we draw on the process-relational view, according to which pointing develops as infants learn how others respond to their initially non-communicative index finger use. We report on a longitudinal maternal diary study of 15 infants and describe four types of index finger use in the first year. Analysis of the observations suggests one possible developmental pathway: index finger extension becomes linked to infants' attention around 7 to 9 months of age with the emergence of fingertip exploration and index finger extension towards out-of-reach objects infants wish to explore. Through parental responses infants begin to use index finger touch to refer in some situations, including asking and answering questions and to request, suggesting that some functions of pointing might originate in early index finger use.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444922;wos311;Playing Charades in the fMRI: Are Mirror and/or Mentalizing Areas Involved in Gestural Communication?;"Schippers M B; Gazzola V; Goebel R; Keysers C";Journal Article;Communication is an important aspect of human life, allowing us to powerfully coordinate our behaviour with that of others. Boiled down to its mere essentials, communication entails transferring a mental content from one brain to another. Spoken language obviously plays an important role in communication between human individuals. Manual gestures however often aid the semantic interpretation of the spoken message, and gestures may have played a central role in the earlier evolution of communication. Here we used the social game of charades to investigate the neural basis of gestural communication by having participants produce and interpret meaningful gestures while their brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. While participants decoded observed gestures, the putative mirror neuron system (pMNS: premotor, parietal and posterior mid-temporal cortex), associated with motor simulation, and the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), associated with mentalizing and agency attribution, were significantly recruited. Of these areas only the pMNS was recruited during the production of gestures. This suggests that gestural communication relies on a combination of simulation and, during decoding, mentalizing/agency attribution brain areas. Comparing the decoding of gestures with a condition in which participants viewed the same gestures with an instruction not to interpret the gestures showed that although parts of the pMNS responded more strongly during active decoding, most of the pMNS and the TPJ did not show such significant task effects. This suggests that the mere observation of gestures recruits most of the system involved in voluntary interpretation.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445258;wos312;Russian multichannel discourse part ii a corpus development and avenues of research;Kibrik AA;Journal Article;In the first part of this paper, published in issue 1, 2018, the notion of multichannel discourse was introduced as a novel and promising object of investigation. In contrast to the traditional view of language as verbal structure, a more encompassing view was proposed, in which language involves a wide range of communication channels. The verbal channel and the prosodic channel, the latter including numerous components, are realized in the vocal (auditory) modality. The kinetic (visual) modality is represented as a large set of communication channels, including eye movements, various kinds of gestures, and proxemics. The principles of annotating the major communication channels were considered, including the verbal channel, the manual gestures, and the oculomotor channel. In the present part of the paper the resource 'Russian Pear Chats and Stories' is discussed. The resource consists of the recordings of natural communication between several participants, along with the vocal and kinetic annotation. The resource has been created within the framework of a integrated theoretical and methodological approach towards multichannel discourse. The recordings were made with the help of original technical solutions, including high quality audio and video capture and eye tracking. This forms a basis for a program of multichannel studies, including the general notions of communication theory and the problem of interaction between channels. A review is provided of the main avenues of contemporary research in the domain of multichannel communication. The concluding section summarizes the findings of both parts of the paper and suggests the future research perspectives.

In this paper, a range of simulations are used to extend the tradition of theories of meaning as use. The authors work throughout with large spatialized arrays of sessile individuals in an environment of wandering food sources and predators. Individuals gain points by feeding and lose points when they are hit by a predator and are not hiding. They can also make sounds heard by immediate neighbours in the array, and can respond to sounds from immediate neighbours. No inherent meaning for these sounds is built into the simulation; under what circumstances they are sent, if any, and what the response to them is, if any, vary initially with the strategies randomized across the array. These sounds do take on a specific function for communities of individuals, however, with any of three forms of strategy change: direct imitation of strategies of successful neighbours, a localized genetic algorithm in which strategies are 'crossed' with those of successful neighbours, and neural net training on the behaviour of successful neighbours. Starting from an array randomized across a large number of strategies, and using any of these modes of strategy change, communities of 'communicators' emerge. Within these evolving communities the sounds heard from immediate neighbours, initially arbitrary across the array, come to be used for very specific communicative functions. 'Communicators' make a particular sound on feeding and respond to that same sound from neighbours by opening their mouths; they make a different sound when hit with a predator and respond to that sound by hiding. Robustly and persistently, even in simple computer models of communities of self-interested agents, something suggestively like signalling emerges and spreads.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445095;wos314;Where did language come from? Connecting sign, song, and speech in hominin evolution;Killin A;Journal Article;Recently theorists have developed competing accounts of the origins and nature of protolanguage and the subsequent evolution of language. Debate over these accounts is lively. Participants ask: Is music a direct precursor of language? Were the first languages gestural? Or is language continuous with primate vocalizations, such as the alarm calls of vervets? In this article I survey the leading hypotheses and lines of evidence, favouring a largely gestural conception of protolanguage. However, the 'sticking point'' of gestural accounts, to use Robbins Burling's phrase, is the need to explain how language shifted to a largely vocal medium. So with a critical eye I consider Michael Corballis's most recent expression of his ideas about this transition (2017's The Truth About Language: What It Is And Where It Came From). Corballis's view is an excellent foil to mine and I present it as such. Contrary to Corballis's account, and developing Burling's conjecture that musicality played some role, I argue that the foundations of an evolving musicality (i.e., evolving largely independently of language) provided the means and medium for the shift from gestural to vocal dominance in language. In other words, I suggest that an independently evolving musicality prepared ancient hominins, morphologically and cognitively, for intentional articulate vocal production, enabling the evolution of speech.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Tomasello's treatise on shared intentionality, the development of human thought and culture is seen to be rooted in social cooperation. This connects to the theoretical constructs of Adler and Vygotskij, but these ideas are understood here in terms of evolutionary development. Human thought begins with cooperation and a pointing gesture involving joint attention on a third object. When early man began to live together in larger groups, social cognition started to play an essential role. This led to a collective intentionality and the development of culture and language. Epistemic trust and social learning led in turn to the passing down of knowledge through the generations. The ability to mentalise appears to play a key role in all this, as it provides a model of the development of the self in a relational and cultural context.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, it is unclear whether this is due to children's learning processes or to a more general effect of iterative learning. We investigated whether typically developing children, without iterative learning, segment and linearize information. Gestures produced in the absence of speech to express a motion event were examined in 4-year-olds, 12-year-olds, and adults (all native English speakers). We compared the proportions of gestural expressions that segmented semantic elements into linear sequences and that encoded them simultaneously. Compared with adolescents and adults, children reshaped the holistic stimuli by segmenting and recombining their semantic features into linearized sequences. A control task on recognition memory ruled out the possibility that this was due to different event perception or memory.

22445436;wos319;A contamination with paranormal phenomenon in local community in the early new ages;Kos D;Journal Article;"In 1689, in 'Die Ehre des Herzogthums Crain', Janez Vajkard Valvasor published a three page report on appearances in the castle of Novi dvor and in the manor of Stari dvor near Radece (Slovenia) of the spirit of the noblewoman Marija Elizabeta of Gallenberg, who had died in 1665. An extrasensory phenomenon known and described for millennia can be recognised in the appearances of her spirit to the castle cook and other persons, to the castle owner Sigmund Viljem Baron Cecker and to local clergy, between January 15th and 25th 1684.



Appeasing spirits, which draw the attention of the living to the link with the world of the dead and to sin, is one of the original human traumas and the foundation of almost all religions. However, physical contact of the living world with the dead is dangerous, since it contaminates human values and ideologies and, in Christianity, also directly the dogma of life after death, salvation and resurrection. Rationally, we can examine only suspicions of deception, as well as ideological and material contamination of events with high and popular cultural examples. Valvasor did not mention any kind of doubts in relation to the appearances of 1684, undoubtedly mainly because the deceased was the aunt of his second wife and the owner of Novi dvor was his brother-in-law. In another context, when commenting similar appearances, he was involved in a long polemic with his German editor, Erasmus Francisci, on the veracity and nature of such appearances of spirits. Valvasor explained them with Renaissance and Baroque theories on life and transformation of the spirit after bodily death; and above all with the then popular theories of astral and life spirit, which differed considerably from Christian teachings on the soul.



Some months after the appearances in Novi dvor, on the orders of the Apostolic Nuncio to Vienna, the Ljubljana diocesan court wanted to examine their veracity. The hearing of all the witnesses to the appearances, and especially the main medium of poltergeist activities, the castle cook Ana, posed the key questions for the detection of orthodoxy, superstition and deception in the local community From basic information obtained in advance from the Archdeacon of Savinja-Valley, the investigators found that these were not mystical visions or pagan apparitions from popular tradition but an orthodox event, such as had already been described several times in theological treatises. The locations of the appearances were not church premises but private buildings. Jesus or the Virgin Mary did not appear to people but a deceased lay person and several times, and never in the semi-conscious states and dreams in which the majority of unprovable visions normally occurred The appearances seemed material because the spirit was capable of speaking with the people, not just making noises as a poltergeist.



At the hearings, some showed traditional suspicion in relation to a distortion of orthodoxy by female depravity, since they raised the question of the cook's questionable morals. Ana had entered service at Novi dvor only a few days before the appearances, bringing with her an illegitimate son and had already changed her employer six times. She had even been in prison a short time prior to this because of an accusation of theft. The motive of the appearances raised a suspicion of principle: the spirit of the deceased lady of the castle did not demand from her nephew, Baron of Cecker, the righting of a financial injustice formerly caused, of a modest 60 goldinars, but only the saying of 30 masses for the salvation of her soul in front of the altar of St. Anthony of Padua in the local church in Jagnjenica by Radece. This succursal church was under the supervision of the neighbouring priest in Svibno, who was Ana's former employer and was himself in constant conflict with the surrounding farmers and nobility about various financial matters. The servants also testified to contamination of the pious appearances with the morally questionable activities of the castle inhabitants, mentioning immoderate drinking of the staff almost ritual terrorizing of maids, and farm labourers staying secretly in the women's rooms overnight; all when the lord of the castle was absent. The servants confirmed the arrival and departure and speech of the spirit, the gestures of those present and the fear with which the observers of the appearances that evening were filled The priests carefully recorded their unsuccessful attempts to establish communication with the spirit (who spoke only to Ana) and to appease it. Ana's supposed immorality thus did not fatally impair belief in the truth of the matter.



The Novi dvor and Stari dvor events depict for us better than for the then investigators, a picture of an interweaving of the collective consciousness with high and popular culture. It was a problem of mutual contamination of theology and homilectics with popular perceptions of death, the soul and purgatory. From the 13th century on, the description of appearances of spirits as requests for help in righting old material injustices and salvation from purgatory was the most frequent motif in post-Christian popular culture, in church miracles and in Renaissance and Baroque homilectics on doctrines of purgatory. It appears that, even in the 17th century, preachers and local priests did not devote themselves to salvation of the spirit and the concept of purgatory to the extent that would be expected from such an important theme. Preachers in Slovenia did not mention purgatory within detailed teachings on sin, salvation, heaven and hell. In practice, teaching about post-mortal life focused on the two poles of life after death before the final judgment: the soul of those who live a Christian life goes to heaven, that of sinners to hell.



It is no coincidence that, in terms of content, almost the same sin as the deceased Marija Elizabeta committed was the core of one of the legends - about St Anthony of Padua about the steward and the false lord Based on a Baroque Italian legend, it was so popular in Slovene lands in the 18th and 19th centuries. However lady Marija Elizabeta, who formerly committed almost the same injustice with financial calculations, did not suffer after death in hell but in purgatory. According to official doctrine and in practice, she could only come for help from there and only from there could she go to heaven after the masses had been said Clearly in depicting her appearances, popular tradition did not appropriate a leading role; this was essentially taken from high culture or from popular science treatises on the appearances of spirits. Because an educated person independently created the first, the dialogues between the spirit and witnesses were slightly reshaped and accorded with church doctrine. Despite suspicions about the depositions, the diocesan court in the end quietly recognised that the spirit of the deceased really showed itself to the living. Without a formal judgment, the court allowed the events gradually to sink into oblivion. After the masses had been said, the spirit never again showed itself to anyone there.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

22445544;wos325;Meaningful Gesture in Monkeys? Investigating whether Mandrills Create Social Culture;Laidre ME;Journal Article;"Background: Human societies exhibit a rich array of gestures with cultural origins. Often these gestures are found exclusively in local populations, where their meaning has been crafted by a community into a shared convention. In nonhuman primates like African monkeys, little evidence exists for such culturally-conventionalized gestures.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Here I report a striking gesture unique to a single community of mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) among nineteen studied across North America, Africa, and Europe. The gesture was found within a community of 23 mandrills where individuals old and young, female and male covered their eyes with their hands for periods which could exceed 30 min, often while simultaneously raising their elbow prominently into the air. This 'Eye covering' gesture has been performed within the community for a decade, enduring deaths, removals, and births, and it persists into the present. Differential responses to Eye covering versus controls suggested that the gesture might have a locally-respected meaning, potentially functioning over a distance to inhibit interruptions as a 'do not disturb' sign operates.
Conclusions/Significance: The creation of this gesture by monkeys suggests that the ability to cultivate shared meanings using novel manual acts may be distributed more broadly beyond the human species. Although logistically difficult with primates, the translocation of gesturers between communities remains critical to experimentally establishing the possible cultural origin and transmission of nonhuman gestures.";Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

22445587;wos327;Cognitive systems struggling for word order;"Langus A; Nespor M";Journal Article;We argue that the grammatical diversity observed among the world's languages emerges from the struggle between individual cognitive systems trying to impose their preferred structure on human language. We investigate the cognitive bases of the two most common word orders in the world's languages: SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) and SVO. Evidence from language change, grammaticalization, stability of order, and theoretical arguments, indicates a syntactic preference for SVO. The reason for the prominence of SOV languages is not as clear. In two gesture-production experiments and one gesture comprehension experiment, we show that SOV emerges as the preferred constituent configuration in participants whose native languages (Italian and Turkish) have different word orders. We propose that improvised communication does not rely on the computational system of grammar. The results of a fourth experiment, where participants comprehended strings of prosodically flat words in their native language, shows that the computational system of grammar prefers the orthogonal Verb-Object orders.

22445496;wos328;Do the hands have it? The facilitation effects of arm and hand gesture on word retrieval in aphasia;"Lanyon L; Rose M L";Journal Article;"Conference:
38th Annual Clinical Aphasiology Conference
Background: There is considerable disagreement in the literature concerning the function of co-verbal gesture. Studies of the relationship between speech and gesture have employed an array of methods to investigate the origin and functions of arm and hand gesture. Commonly, these studies have utilised an experimental design to examine possible speech facilitation effects. However there is a need to examine spontaneous gesture production and its effect on speech production, as evidence suggests that natural gesture production is distinct from that produced under test conditions. Aims: To investigate the possible facilitation effects of spontaneously generated arm and hand gestures during word retrieval difficulty in people with aphasia. Methods Procedures: Conversational samples 20 minutes long were acquired from 18 participants with chronic aphasia. Verbal utterances were transcribed for word retrieval difficulty, resolved word retrieval difficulty, and fluent speech production. The transcription was augmented with all arm and hand gestures produced by the participants. Gestures were segmented into gesture units and classified into types. A second rater classified 20% of the samples for gesture type, occurrence of word retrieval difficulty, and whether the difficulty was successfully resolved or not. Consensus ratings were carried out where disagreement occurred. Variables were paired for comparison using a series of non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Tests. Outcomes Results: Gesture production was significantly higher during instances of word retrieval difficulties. The resolution of word retrieval difficulty was significantly more frequent with a gesture present. Crucially, there was no significant difference between the amounts of gesture produced during resolved, as compared to unresolved, word retrieval difficulties. However performance in the group was variable. Five individuals produced over 50% more gesture during resolved word retrieval events than during unresolved. Post-hoc examination of the linguistic characteristics of these five participants suggested they had a specific phonological level impairment. Conclusions: Gesture production is multifunctional for people with aphasia. People with mild aphasia, who have the majority of their linguistic resources still accessible, are likely to experience facilitation from gesture production, and hence gesture treatment maybe an appropriate and potent therapy focus. Some individuals with severe language impairment are capable of using many rich, communicative gestures. Such gesture expression should be explored as a viable component of a ototal communicationo therapeutic approach for those individuals.";Excluded;NA;Neuro-atypical subjects;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

After callosal infarction, the patient gesticulated predominantly unilaterally with the left hand despite left apraxia. Bilateral gesticulation occurred later on and was presumably achieved by an increase in ipsilateral proximal control. Movement analysis further indicated that the two hemispheres are specialized for certain gesture types. Gestures with emotional connotation and batons (emphasizing prosody) were generated predominantly in the right hemisphere whereas physiographics which picture the linguistic content concretely and deictics (pointing) were of left-hemispheric origin.

23080872;wos335;Wearables and Social Signal Processing for Smarter Public Presentations;"Mihoub A; Lefebvre G";Journal Article;Social Signal Processing techniques have given the opportunity to analyze in-depth human behavior in social face-to-face interactions. With recent advancements, it is henceforth possible to use these techniques to augment social interactions, especially human behavior in oral presentations. The goal of this study is to train a computational model able to provide a relevant feedback to a public speaker concerning his/her coverbal communication. Hence, the role of this model is to augment the social intelligence of the orator and then the relevance of his/her presentation. To this end, we present an original interaction setting in which the speaker is equipped with only wearable devices. Several coverbal modalities have been extracted and automatically annotated namely speech volume, intonation, speech rate, eye gaze, hand gestures, and body movements.

22445517;wos336;Translation practice in the social media: an improved translation text for a virtual community?;Lesch HM;Journal Article;"A method increasingly used to provide translation in the computer era is crowdsourcing. This practice is widely exercised in the open-source community and has become quite sophisticated The 'crowd' comes in various forms: customers, brand advocates, domain experts, passionate users and the 'unwashed masses'. All of these take the form of multilingual communities whose translation work may be integrated with existing translation workflows. However, there are still many misconceptions and myths about the outcomes of crowdsourcing when applied to translation.



Three major phenomena in harnessing the power of the crowd for translation purposes have been identified by Rebecca Ray and Nataly Kelly (2011). The first is community translation (or social translation) which is usually performed on voluntary basis by members of a group or by people with common interests. These groups are often cause-focused; interested in obtaining access to information in their own language; or simply people devoted to language. The second is collaborative technology and processes which allow a community to develop around a project and to work on the same content. Community members can verify and rectify one another's work as they go along. The term 'collaborative translation' is also used to describe the work of professional translation teams working as a swarm where multiple translators interact with the same content simultaneously, using advanced translation memory tools. The third, crowdsourcing, opens up a translation project to teams comprising of any mix of volunteer translators, employees, contractors or language service providers. It leverages the power of the swarm to accomplish much more than a single translator or language service provider can do alone. These three methods have supported one another to such an extent that the boundaries between them have faded.



However, this paper argues that crowdsourced translation for a virtual community expands on community translation as originally developed for educationally deprived communities, with specifically the linguistically deprived as target readers of translated texts. Multicultural societies, such as those in South Africa, where heterogeneous target audiences require translation, use community translation as a vehicle for effective communication (Lesch 2004; 1999). Otherwise a translation will only be a symbolic gesture, empty of value, and thus not communicating the message intended This article argues that a functional approach ensures that translations are meaningful acts, and that this approach may serve as a translation paradigm for multilingual countries and global virtual institutions.



Different readers and listeners must be addressed in writing (and in speaking) at a level that they can understand In the multicultural context found in many countries, a plain language approach to translation for communication purposes entails that those who produce texts must consider plain language for effective communication. At the same time it should be borne in mind that there are various,degrees of plainness. The communicator and translator can achieve a relative plainness, for instance, a plainer language that is more adequate in the eyes and ears of the audience than the legalese Afrikaans version. In terms of communication it represents an improvement of the original source text language. The concept of plain language is dynamic and varies according to the target audience. Translators can adopt one of two approaches. They either think of a text in terms of plain language before translating, or they transfer a text into plain language during the translation process. The latter approach deals with rephrasing and adaptation as part of the construction of target texts. lam of the opinion that this is the better way to ensure effective intercultural communication across power gaps in a heterogeneous country, and that this also applies to the generic reader on the internet.



It goes without saying that this translation strategy is useful for effective understanding of the target text when communicating a message to widely heterogeneous audiences, including some with limited educational backgrounds, and for effective communication across a wide cultural spectrum and power gaps.



Consequently, this article draws on norms that have been developed for the community translation practice prior to the evolution of a virtual internet community, and were designed for target readers with a limited educational background The article raises the question of and initiates debate on whether the proposed norms are also relevant for translation via crowdsourcing. The underlying principle for these norms is using accessible language in crowdsourced and community translation on the internet.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this study, we investigated whether diegetic sound (i.e., sound that seems to originate from the depicted cinematic space) could effectively bridge shots for first-time viewers. Across a range of films, both dialog, and salient environmental sound (e.g., barking dogs) helped first-time viewers connect shots. However, sound was not always successful in supporting first-time viewers' interpretations. While experienced viewers were able to understand less-familiar linking sounds and environments, first-time viewers found this difficult. Overall, a range of diegetic sounds helped first-time viewers understand spatiotemporal relations between shots, but these viewers still had difficulty integrating views of unfamiliar environments.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The relative inflexibility of primate vocal signaling reflects audience pressure for reliability. Where interests conflict, listeners' resistance to being deceived drives signalers to limit their vocal repertoire to signals that cannot be faked. This constraint was lifted in the human case, we argue, because the original victims of our species' first deceptive vocalizations were nonhuman animals. When our ancestors were vulnerable hominins equipped with limited weaponry, they kept predators away by increasing the range and diversity of their vocal calls. This led to choral singing, primarily by females, and deceptive mimicry of animal calls, primarily by scavenging and hunting males. A critical feature of our model is the core principle of reversal, whereby deceptive signals aimed originally by a coalition against an external target are subsequently redeployed for honest communicative purposes within the group. We argue that this dynamic culminated ultimately in gestural, vocal, and ritual metaphor, opening the way to word formation and the rapid emergence of grammar.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For instance, the progressive (I was writing a book) is thought to reflect increased focus on the internal details of an event, as contrasted with the perfect (I had - written a book). However, experimental evidence that speakers describing events using progressive versus non-progressive aspect are in fact thinking about the same events differently is lacking. We used co-speech gesture as a means to investigate what speakers' event representations are like when they produce progressive versus non-progressive utterances. We found that progressive event descriptions were accompanied by longer-lasting and more complex gestures, but only when participants described events originally presented to them in the progressive. This evidence suggests that people are actually construing events differently when they use different grammatical aspects, but that the aspect originally used to encode the events plays a role as well.;Included;Excluded;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As the majority of studies into primates' communication use a unimodal approach with focus on one signal type only, researchers investigate very different aspects depending on whether they are interested in vocal, gestural, or facial communication. Here, we focus on two signal types and discuss how meaning is created in the gestural (visual, tactile/auditory) as compared to the vocal modality in non-human primates, to highlight the different research foci across these modalities. First, we briefly describe the defining features of meaning in human language and introduce some debates concerning meaning in non-human communication. Second, with focus on these features, we summarize the current evidence for meaningful communication in gestural as compared to vocal communication and demonstrate that meaning is operationalized very differently by researchers in these two fields. As a result, it is currently not possible to generalize findings across these modalities. Rather than arguing for or against the occurrence of semantic communication in non-human primates, we aim at pointing to gaps of knowledge in studying meaning in our closest relatives, and these gaps might be closed.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445324;wos341;A stepping stone to compositionality in chimpanzee communication;"Liebal K; Sandler W; Ona L S";Journal Article;Compositionality refers to a structural property of human language, according to which the meaning of a complex expression is a function of the meaning of its parts and the way they are combined. Compositionality is a defining characteristic of all human language, spoken and signed. Comparative research into the emergence of human language aims at identifying precursors to such key features of human language in the communication of other primates. While it is known that chimpanzees, our closest relatives, produce a variety of gestures, facial expressions and vocalizations in interactions with their group members, little is known about how these signals combine simultaneously. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to investigate whether there is evidence for compositional structures in the communication of chimpanzees. We investigated two semi-wild groups of chimpanzees, with focus on their manual gestures and their combinations with facial expressions across different social contexts. If there are compositional structures in chimpanzee communication, adding a facial expression to a gesture should convey a different message than the gesture alone, a difference that we expect to be measurable by the recipient's response. Furthermore, we expect context-dependent usage of these combinations. Based on a form-based coding procedure of the collected video footage, we identified two frequently used manual gestures (stretched arm gesture and bent arm gesture) and two facial expression (bared teeth face and funneled lip face). We analyzed whether the recipients' response varied depending on the signaler's usage of a given gesture + face combination and the context in which these were used. Overall, our results suggest that, in positive contexts, such as play or grooming, specific combinations had an impact on the likelihood of the occurrence of particular responses. Specifically, adding a bared teeth face to a gesture either increased the likelihood of affiliative behavior (for stretched arm gesture) or eliminated the bias toward an affiliative response (for bent arm gesture). We show for the first time that the components under study are recombinable, and that different combinations elicit different responses, a property that we refer to as componentiality. Yet our data do not suggest that the components have consistent meanings in each combination-a defining property of compositionality. We propose that the componentiality exhibited in this study represents a necessary stepping stone toward a fully evolved compositional system.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Yet, while infants frequently positioned themselves in front of the experimenter and pointed towards a distant reward, apes either remained in the experimenter's line of sight and pointed towards him or moved out of sight and pointed towards the reward. Further, when pointing towards a reward that was placed at a distance from the experimenter, only the infants, and not the apes, took the experimenter's attentional state into account. These results demonstrate that prelinguistic human infants and nonhuman apes use different means when guiding others' attention to a location; indicating that differing cognitive mechanisms may underlie their pointing gestures.";Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He also weaved it into a typology of political regimes and performance arts, identifying it with a particular kind of republican politics and public festivals.

22444848;wos347;Vocal greeting during mother-infant reunions in a nocturnal primate, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus);"Scheumann M; Linn S; Zimmermann E";Journal Article;In human societies, ritualized greeting behavior includes gestural and vocal displays to signal the social acceptance of an encountering person. These displays are universal across cultures suggesting a pre-human origin. Vocal greeting displays are only reported for monkeys and apes with complex social systems, but none of these studies confirmed that greeting signals fulfill all criteria characterizing human greeting behavior. In this study, we analyzed for the first time whether vocal exchanges between mother and infants in a non-human primate fulfill the criteria of human greeting behavior and whether vocal greeting behavior is present in a basal primate with a less complex social system, the gray mouse lemur. By comparing spontaneous leave-takings and reunions, we found that vocal exchanges during mother-infant reunions fulfilled all six criteria characterizing human greeting behavior. Thus, predictable reciprocal vocal exchanges occurred at the start of the reunion (but not during leave-taking), when mother and infant had visual contact to each other. Thus, we argued that mother-infant vocal exchanges governing reunions are essential to establish social bonds and to ritualize the greeting function. Our findings suggest that ritualized vocal greeting has its origins deeply rooted in mammalian phylogeny and derives from vocal exchanges during parent-infant reunions.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Following a synthesis of naturalistic and experimental studies of language creation, we propose a theoretical model that describes the process through which human communication systems might arise and evolve. Three key processes are proposed that give rise to effective, efficient and shared human communication systems: (1) motivated signs that directly resemble their meaning facilitate cognitive alignment, improving communication success; (2) behavioral alignment onto an inventory of shared sign-to-meaning mappings bolsters cognitive alignment between interacting partners; (3) sign refinement, through interactive feedback, enhances the efficiency of the evolving communication system. By integrating the findings across a range of diverse studies, we propose a theoretical model of the process through which the earliest human communication systems might have arisen and evolved.

Renewed interest in the relationship between manual and vocal behavior draws attention to its development. Here, the pointing and vocalization of 16.5-month-old infants are reported as a function of the context in which they occurred. When infants operated in a referential mode, the frequency of simultaneous vocalization and pointing exceeded the frequency of vocalization-only and pointing-only responses by a wide margin. In a non-communicative context, combinatorial effects persisted, but in weaker form. Manual-vocal signals thus appear to express the operation of an integrated system, arguably adaptive in the young from evolutionary times to the present, It was speculated, based on reported evidence, that manual behavior increases the frequency and complexity of vocal behaviors in modern infants. There may be merit in the claim that manual behavior facilitated the evolution of language because it helped make available, early in development, behaviors that under selection pressures in later ontogenetic stages elaborated into speech.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ii evolutionary benefits associated with language were predominantly referential, as many theorists assume, then there must have been a preparatory stage in which an 'apptrtite for information, not evident in the other primates, developed. To date, no such stage has been demonstrated. The problem dissipates, however, if it is assumed that language emerged from a function more nearly shared with other primates. An obvious candidate is displaying. Here I argue that performative functions associated with oral sound-making provided initial pressures for vocal communication by promoting rank and relationships. These benefits, I suggest, facilitated conflict avoidance and resolution, collaboration, and reciprocal sharing of needed resources. By valuing the performative applications of language, which continue in modern humans, one can more easily derive speech from the social-vocal behaviours of non-human primates, providing greater continuity in accounts of linguistic evolution.";Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this study, we argue that the observed relationship between verbal and non-verbal behaviors depends on the level of analysis. In a reanalysis of a corpus of naturalistic multimodal communication (Louwerse, Dale, Bard, & Jeuniaux, ), we focus on measuring the temporal patterns of specific communicative behaviors in terms of their burstiness. We examined burstiness estimates across different roles of the speaker and different communicative modalities. We observed more burstiness for verbal versus non-verbal channels, and for more versus less informative language subchannels. Using this new method for analyzing temporal patterns in communicative behaviors, we show that there is a complex relationship between verbal and non-verbal channels. We propose a temporal heterogeneity hypothesis to explainhow the language system adapts to the demands of dialog.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We further analyze gesture form and use in relation to the age of the sender with special consideration of the reaction of the receiver to better explain the function of the hand-on.

New Insights on Social Transmission in Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Captivity;"Luef E M; Pike S";Journal Article;"The present paper describes two distinct behaviors relating to food processing and communication that were observed in a community of five separately housed groups of lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in captivity during two study periods one decade apart: (1) a food processing technique to separate wheat from chaff, the so-called PUFF-BLOWING technique; and (2) a male display used to attract the attention of visitors, the so-called THROW-KISS-DISPLAY. We investigated (a) whether the behaviors were transmitted within the respective groups; and if yes, (b) their possible mode of transmission. Our results showed that only the food processing technique spread from three to twenty-one individuals during the ten-year period, whereas the communicative display died out completely. The main transmission mode of the PUFF-BLOWING technique was the mother-offspring dyad: offspring of PUFF-BLOWING mothers showed the behavior, while the offspring of non- PUFF-BLOWING mothers did not. These results strongly support the role mothers play in the acquisition of novel skills and vertical social transmission. Furthermore, they suggest that behaviors, which provide a direct benefit to individuals, have a high chance of social transmission while the loss of benefits can result in the extinction of behaviors.";Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

22445080;wos357;Iconicity can ground the creation of vocal symbols;"Perlman M; Dale R; Lupyan G";Journal Article;Studies of gestural communication systems find that they originate from spontaneously created iconic gestures. Yet, we know little about how people create vocal communication systems, and many have suggested that vocalizations do not afford iconicity beyond trivial instances of onomatopoeia. It is unknown whether people can generate vocal communication systems through a process of iconic creation similar to gestural systems. Here, we examine the creation and development of a rudimentary vocal symbol system in a laboratory setting. Pairs of participants generated novel vocalizations for 18 different meanings in an iterative 'vocal' charades communication game. The communicators quickly converged on stable vocalizations, and naive listeners could correctly infer their meanings in subsequent playback experiments. People's ability to guess the meanings of these novel vocalizations was predicted by how close the vocalization was to an iconic 'meaning template' we derived from the production data. These results strongly suggest that the meaningfulness of these vocalizations derived from iconicity. Our findings illuminate a mechanism by which iconicity can ground the creation of vocal symbols, analogous to the function of iconicity in gestural communication systems.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, experimental exploration of the capacities of nonhumans is the only option to determine which, if any, language-associated capacities are unique to humans.

22445028;wos360;A pause as a means of nonverbal communication in JD Salinger's works;Lyubimskaya O M;Journal Article;"The present article deals with nonverbal means of communication as the main elements of J. D. Salinger's poetics of silence. A gesture and a pause are particularly important types of nonverbal expression in Salinger's artistic world. Moreover, in most cases they are used together. Salinger widens the meaning of a pause in his texts: addition to its primary meaning as temporary break in speech, a pause should be read as the break of any movements and gestures at the same time. Only under these circumstances Salinger's characters show their genuine and deep attention to the subject of the conversation. A pause as a communicatively significant element of Salinger's dialog fragments is the subject of this paper. The material of the research is Salinger's novel 'The Catcher in the Rye'.



The article comes to the conclusion that a pause in the designated novel is used as an original artistic method to denote the areas of informative silence. The presence or absence of a pause in Salinger's dialogs equally bears some meaning, forms the subtext of the novel and determines the character system. A pause in the novel 'The Catcher in the Rye' is a nonverbal equivalent of hidden soulful impulses and experiences of the characters.

22445748;wos361;Towards computational models of animal communications, an introduction for computer scientists;Ma Z S;Journal Article;"Animals communicate with each other via varieties of signal modalities such as visual, acoustic, semiochemicals, gestural, or communication behavior. Although animal communication has been studied as a signaler-receiver dyadic system until recently, it is actually a complex network due to the ubiquitous existence of third-party receivers in their signaling space, such as eavesdroppers, bystanders, and audiences. A question of fundamental importance in both science and humanity is whether or not animal signals are honest or deceitful (i.e., communication reliability) since it may shed light on the study of trust and altruism in human beings. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, the state-of-the-art research in animal communication (dyadic paradigm) and animal communication networks (network paradigm) and their potential inspiration for secure, resilient and pervasive computing are reviewed. Secondly, by arguing that competition, cooperation and communication are the three fundamental elements that natural selection acts upon in the evolution of organisms, and by comparing the study of cooperation (such as formulated as the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game), with the study of animal communication (such as formulated with Sir Philip Sydney (SPS) game), it is suggested that the latter field may spawn important cross-disciplinary research with the potential influence similar to or beyond that generated by the PD game research. The paper also summarizes the recent extension to evolutionary game theory (EGT) with survival analysis and dynamic hybrid fault models by the author. Finally, seven open questions, with regard to animal communication inspired computing and communication, primarily from the interdisciplinary perspective are posed. As a side note, this is the second article of a two-part series in which I review the state-of-the-art research in behavior biology inspired computing and communication. Given the extensive scope of behavior biology, I only focus on two fields most relevant to computing and communication animal cognition (part one, Ma, 2014) and communication (this article). The previous part one reviewed animal-cognition inspired computing; part one also presented an overview of the behavior biology inspired computing. This part two is focused on animal communication; the relationship between cognition and communication is mainly discussed in this part also. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

23080828;wos362;Multi-objective optimization for hand posture recognition;"Chevtchenko S F; Vale R F; Macario V";Journal Article;Hand gestures are an intuitive way for humans to interact with computers. They are becoming increasingly popular in several applications, such as smart houses, games, vehicle infotainment systems, kitchens and operating theaters. An effective human-computer interaction system should aim at both good recognition accuracy and speed. This paper proposes a new approach for static hand gesture recognition. A benchmark database with 36 gestures is used, containing variations in scale, illumination and rotation. Several common image descriptors, such as Fourier, Zernike moments, pseudo-Zernike moments, Hu moments, complex moments and Gabor features are comprehensively compared in terms of their respective accuracy and speed. Gesture recognition is undertaken by a multilayer perceptron which has a flexible structure and fast recognition. In order to achieve improved accuracy and minimize computational cost, both the feature vector and the neural network are tuned by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods. A real-time gesture recognition system based on the proposed descriptor is constructed and evaluated. Experimental results show a good recognition rate, using a descriptor with low computational cost and reduced size. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Individual differences in human infants, but not chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, are also explained by correlated variance in these cooperative communicative skills. Relative to nonhuman apes, domestic dogs, Canis familiaris, perform more like human infants in cooperative communicative tasks, but it is unknown whether dog and human cognition share a similar underlying structure. We tested 552 dogs in a large-scale test battery modelled after similar work with humans and nonhuman apes. Unlike chimpanzees, but similarly to humans, individual differences in dogs were explained by correlated variance in skills for solving cooperative communicative problems. Direct comparisons of data from all three species revealed similar patterns of individual differences in cooperative communication between human infants (N = 105) and domestic dogs (N = 430), which were not observed in chimpanzees (N = 106). Future research will be needed to examine whether the observed similarities are a result of similar psychological mechanisms and evolutionary processes in the dog and human lineages.

23080842;wos364;Captive gibbons (Hylobatidae) use different referential cues in an object-choice task: insights into lesser ape cognition and manual laterality;"Caspar K R; Mader L; Pallasdies F; Lindenmeier M; Begall S";Journal Article;"Background. Utilization of visual referential cues by non-human primates is a subject of constant scientific interest. However, only few primate species, mostly great apes, have been studied thoroughly in that regard, rendering the understanding of phylogenetic influences on the underlying cognitive patterns difficult.
Methods. We tested six species of captive gibbons in an object-choice task (n = 11) for their ability to interpret two different pointing gestures, a combination of body orientation and gaze direction as well as glancing as referential cues. Hand preferences were tested in the object-choice task and in a birnanual tube task (n = 18).
Results. We found positive responses to all signals except for the glancing cue at the individual as well as at the group level. The gibbons' success rates partially exceed results reported for great apes in comparable tests and appear to be similarly influenced by prior exposure to human communicative cues. Hand preferences exhibited by the gibbons in the object-choice task as well as in a birrianual tube task suggest that crested gibbons (Nomascus sp.) are strongly lateralized at individual but not at population level for tasks involving object manipulation.
Discussion. Based on the available data, it can be assumed that the cognitive foundations to utilize different visual cues essential to human communication are conserved in extant hominoids and can be traced back at least to the common ancestor of great and lesser apes. However, future studies have to further investigate how the social environment of gibbons influences their ability to exploit referential signals. Gibbons' manual laterality patterns appear to differ in several aspects from the situation found in great apes. While not extensive enough to allow for general conclusions about the evolution of hand preferences in gibbons or apes in, general, our results add to the expanding knowledge on, manual lateralization in the Hylobatidae.";Included;Excluded;Non-spontaneous communication;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There are significant individual differences in the use of AG sounds by chimpanzees and, here, we examined whether changes in cortical organization of the central sulcus (CS) were associated with AG sound production. MRI scans were collected from 240 chimpanzees, including 122 that reliably produced AG sounds and 118 that did not. For each subject, the depth of CS was quantified along the superior-inferior plane with specific interest in the inferior portion corresponding to the region of the motor cortex where the mouth and orofacial movements are controlled. Results indicated that CS depth in the inferior, but not superior, portion was significantly greater in chimpanzees that reliably produced AG sounds compared with those who did not. Quantitative genetic analyses indicated that overall CS surface area and depth were significantly heritable, particularly in the superior regions, but less so in the inferior and central portions. Further, heritability in CS depth was altered as a function of acquisition of AG sounds. The collective results suggest that learning to produce AG sounds resulted in region-specific cortical reorganization within the inferior portion of the CS, a finding previously undocumented in chimpanzees or any nonhuman primate.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Gesture sequences occurred at critical periods during the design session, such as idea evolution and developing shared understanding. They are used to act out design concepts, repeat and learn from sequences, and establish shared understanding.

22444847;wos367;Emergent learnables in second language classroom interaction;"Majlesi AR; Broth M";Journal Article;This paper studies how unplanned 'learnables' emerge in classroom interaction. A 'learnable' is defined as whatever is interactively established as relevant and developed to become a shared pedagogical focus. A learnable can thus be related to any social practice. In the context that we are studying, a Swedish as a second language classroom, we show how interactive processes constructing something as a learnable may originate not only in the use of an unknown Swedish word whose meaning is then asked for (which amounts to a verbal source for a learnable), but also in an unknown name for an object (a material source for a learnable) or an unknown meaning of a gesture (a gestural source for a learnable). These last two sources have not been much described in the existing literature on objects of learning. Through detailed analyses of video recorded classroom interaction, focusing on the ways in which participants gradually accomplish learnables, we show how learnables can arise, step by step, in and for the relevant needs of an emergent learning project that may be quite different from the teacher's pedagogical agenda.

22444945;wos368;Chosen aspects of cross-cultural adaptation of neuropsychological tests;"Marcinkowska A; Sitek E";Journal Article;Neuropsychological test outcomes are influenced by education, literacy, ethnic origin and the culture background of the patient. One of the greatest neuropsychological challenges in the 21st century is to create a diagnostic tool that measures a pure cognitive process, regardless of the level of education or the national and cultural background of the patient. The paper is aimed at presenting selected problems associated with the adaptation of neuropsychological tests focusing on their feasibility in another culture. Culture-fairness of testing is associated with tasks used, their content and the testing context. In some non-Western cultures, psychometric testing is inadequate, as testing as such is atypical. Cognitive tests not only need normative data for each culture, but they also require cultural adaptation of tasks. Visuospatial tests are considered to be more 'culture-fair' than verbal tasks, but some of the test results may be dependent on semantic knowledge. Likewise, the praxis tasks requiring performance or imitation of communicative gestures depends on their prior knowledge and use in a given culture. When adapting memory tests (especially tests of logical memory) for use in a new cultural context, particular emphasis should be put on the relevance of the material for the target population. As executive function tests engage more basic cognitive processes (such as language and visuospatial function, praxis and memory), their adaptation is associated with all of the elements outlined above. Also, since culture influences problem-solving strategies, some tasks may be irrelevant for a different culture due to the problem structure and not the task content. Creating culture-free cognitive measures, including screening tests, is very challenging. Further studies should focus on devising new tools adapted to specific cultural contexts with the proper understanding of the population at which the test is targeted.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

22445365;wos371;Materialization of Thought in the Language and Drawing;Markova LA;Journal Article;The idea originated in the human head remains inaccessible to other people as long as it does not acquire some material form as a material carrier, available for the perception of sensory organs. Language, a drawing, picture, any work of art, the gesture of a certain destination, the technical device (garget housing, for example) and so on can be such a material carrier. Inevitably a question arises about the interaction between thought and its material carrier as the interaction between mind and matter (res cogitans and res extensa). The spiritual beginning, the idea, is embodied in such material objects like letters, paints, lines, plastics and so on. Writers, artists, engineers manage to implement in some way such a transformation of their thought. On the other hand, how a reader, a viewer can extract an idea of what they see or hear? A viewer sees forms, paints, images of objects, but how to get out of this pile of material things the author's initial intuitive idea?

Obviously not, because there was no intent (plan), which can be detected only at the beginning of the thought, where thought is inseparable from its possible material embodiment. It is here, in the beginning contains the possibility to transfer the thought to another person, who will understand it, if he manages to go back to the origin of the thought in the human head.

22445052;wos373;Communicative value of self cues in aphasia: A re-evaluation;"Tompkins CA; Scharp VL; Marshall RC";Journal Article;"Background: Adults with aphasia often try mightily to produce specific words, but their word-finding attempts are frequently unsuccessful. However, the word retrieval process may contain rich information that communicates a desired message regardless of word-finding success.
Aims: The original article reprinted here reports an investigation that assessed whether patient-generated self cues inherent in the word retrieval process could be interpreted by listener/observers and improve on communicative effectiveness for adults with aphasia. The newly added commentary identifies and reports tentative conclusions from 18 investigations of self-generated cues in aphasia since the 1982 paper. It further provides a rationale for increasing research on self-generated cueing and notes a surprising lack of attention to the questions investigated in the original article. The original research is also connected with more recent qualitative investigations of interactional, as opposed to transactional, communicative exchange.
Methods & Procedures: While performing single-word production tasks, 10 adults with aphasia produced 107 utterances that contained spontaneous word retrieval behaviours. To determine the 'communicative value'' of these behaviours, herein designated self cues or self-generated cues, the utterance-final (potential target) word was edited out and the edited utterances were dubbed onto a videotape. Six naive observers, three of whom received some context about the nature of word retrieval in aphasia and possible topics for the utterances, and three of whom got no information, predicted the target word of each utterance from the word-finding behaviours alone. The communicative value of the self-generated cues was determined for each individual with aphasia by summing percent correct word retrieval and percent correct observer prediction of target words, based on word retrieval behaviours. The newly added commentary describes some challenges of investigating a 'communicative value'' outcome, and indicates what would and would not change about the methods, if we did the study today.
Outcomes & Results: The observer group that was given some context information appeared to be more successful at predicting target words than the group without any such information. Self-generated cues enhanced communication for the majority of individuals with aphasia, with some cues (e. g., descriptions/gestures of action or function) appearing to carry more communicative value than others (e. g., semantic associates). The commentary again indicates how and why we would change this portion of the investigation if conducting the study at this time. Conclusions: The results are consistent with Holland's ( 1977) premise that people with aphasia do well at communication, regardless of the words they produce. The finding that minimal context information may assist observers in understanding the communicative intent of people with aphasia has important implications for training family members to interpret self-generated cues. The new commentary reinforces these conclusions, highlights potential differences between self cues that improve word-finding success and those that enhance message transmission, and points to some additional research needs.";Excluded;NA;Neuro-atypical subjects;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445484;wos374;Body as First Space of Communication The Tonic-Emotional Dialogue in the Beginning of Psychic Life;Martins R;Journal Article;In the early stages of ontogenesis, when the support for development relies upon the relational function of the mother-baby dyad, the child will organise the foundation of the Self. This process involves a physiological and emotional symbiosis, in a relation with predominance of a tonic-emotional dialogue. The presence or absence of the other, the dynamics of nearness/farness, the postural and gestural dynamics, the containment activities, rhythmic synchronicities and thermal contact, are essential supports to primary organization of the psyche. When these processes are inadequate, they can cause problems of individuation and affirmation of identity, linked to absences or deficiencies in the primary relationship between mother and baby. This perspective leads us to equate the importance of corporeality in the early processes of communication when they are mediated primarily by tonic-emotional processes of communication, imbued with affections, desires and emotions. These processes are essential to the organization of the internal processes that make up this pre-linguistic phase, based on the organization of body schema, ensuring a sense of identity and the possibility of individuation and differentiation from the maternal object. When there are disruptions in this evolutionary dynamics, psychomotor therapy is a privileged resource, providing a safe and container space in which through spontaneous and symbolic play, children learn to transform the feelings, acts and affections in thoughts, projects and words. A desired relationship, allows to experience new forms of expression and conflict resolution, improving emotional and behavioural regulation, and promoting mentoring capacity and executive functions (such as attention, working memory, planning and inhibition of impulses).;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These other students, referred to as third-party participants because they are not originally part of the miscommunication phenomena, help resolve miscommunication by sharing their interpretations of what their peers say. Combining sequential analysis with ethnographic information, this study examines how students as third-party participants take initiative in resolving miscommunication by representing their peers' viewpoints and how teachers elicit assistance from these third-party participants. The analysis reveals that third-party participants' repair efforts can be effective in multilingual classrooms in various ways, including helping to save face among interlocutors involved in miscommunication, negotiating meaning, creating active class participation patterns, and engendering the class norm that dealing with miscommunication and achieving mutual understanding are everyone's responsibility in multilingual classrooms. The analysis also demonstrates the important role of nonverbal elements (e.g., gaze, smile, and gesture) for enhancing explicitness in English as a lingua franca communication.

22445625;wos377;Comparative cognitive development;Matsuzawa T;Journal Article;This paper aims to compare cognitive development in humans and chimpanzees to illuminate the evolutionary origins of human cognition. Comparison of morphological data and life history strongly highlights the common features of all primate species, including humans. The human mother-infant relationship is characterized by the physical separation of mother and infant, and the stable supine posture of infants, that enables vocal exchange, face-to-face communication, and manual gestures. The cognitive development of chimpanzees was studied using the participation observation method. It revealed that humans and chimpanzees show similar development until 3 months of age. However, chimpanzees have a unique type of social learning that lacks the social reference observed in human children. Moreover, chimpanzees have unique immediate short-term memory capabilities. Taken together, this paper presents a plausible evolutionary scenario for the uniquely human characteristics of cognition.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23080835;wos379;Body-centrism in advertising texts, or how we are inured to pain;Matsyshyna IV;Journal Article;Advertising is not only a channel for transmitting a message from a sender (customer/producer) to a receiver (consumer). It is also responsible for shaping the attitudes of its recipients. Analysis of advertisements for medicinal products enables us to perceive original codes of the representation of pain by means of the human body. Gestures are not only pain indicators. They also introduce values to the society, which has consciously become visually sick. Thus, pain symbols represent remission as a natural property of reality. The ways by which the media controls the human body in the context of the representation of pain are the key issue of this article. Pain as an emotion becomes a construct that requires a corporeal form. A pattern of behavior is also imposed through the object of the body. Certain postures and gestures of pain turn into indicators of social behavior for recognizing emotions. For that reason, visualization of pain into corporeal form becomes a simplified story device for advertising communication. The main tool of this research is the political and social approach combined with the semiotic method. The results open new dimensions of hidden texts that form diverse attitudes. Filters for the analysis incorporate feminist theory, esthetics as ideology, and new media as text.;Excluded;NA;Neuro-atypical subjects;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445317;wos382;When does a system become phonological? Handshape production in gesturers, signers, and homesigners;"Mazzoni L; Coppola M; Goldin-Meadow S; Brentari D";Journal Article;"Sign languages display remarkable crosslinguistic consistencies in the use of handshapes. In particular, handshapes used in classifier predicates display a consistent pattern in finger complexity: classifier handshapes representing objects display more finger complexity than those representing how objects are handled. Here we explore the conditions under which this morphophonological phenomenon arises. In Study 1, we ask whether hearing individuals in Italy and the United States, asked to communicate using only their hands, show the same pattern of finger complexity found in the classifier handshapes of two sign languages: Italian Sign Language (LIS) and American Sign Language (ASL). We find that they do not: gesturers display more finger complexity in handling handshapes than in object handshapes. The morphophonological pattern found in conventional sign languages is therefore not a codified version of the pattern invented by hearing individuals on the spot. In Study 2, we ask whether continued use of gesture as a primary communication system results in a pattern that is more similar to the morphophonological pattern found in conventional sign languages or to the pattern found in gesturers. Homesigners have not acquired a signed or spoken language and instead use a self-generated gesture system to communicate with their hearing family members and friends. We find that homesigners pattern more like signers than like gesturers: their finger complexity in object handshapes is higher than that of gesturers (indeed as high as signers); and their finger complexity in handling handshapes is lower than that of gesturers (but not quite as low as signers). Generally, our findings indicate two markers of the phonologization of handshape in sign languages: increasing finger complexity in object handshapes, and decreasing finger complexity in handling handshapes. These first indicators of phonology appear to be present in individuals developing a gesture system without benefit of a linguistic community. Finally, we propose that iconicity, morphology, and phonology each play an important role in the system of sign language classifiers to create the earliest markers of phonology at the morphophonological interface.";Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Twenty-four participants (aged 10-11 years) in two locations-primary school classrooms located 300 miles apart in the UK-engaged in simultaneous collaborative activity to solve a History mystery task. Audio-video data recorded in the first minute of the activity were analysed to explore the emergence of collaborative working practices both within groups in the same location (resizing for shared reading) and between the groups communicating via video conferencing software and through the 'flick' multi-touch gesture (sharing clues between groups). The results indicated that most groups focused first on the establishment of intra-group collaboration before reaching out to their remotely located partners. However, when the second data set was analysed, audio data from delayed interviews conducted after the original study, participants reported that the discussion between groups supported by the 'flick' gesture was the most important and memorable feature of the activity.

A storytelling model is examined, including its effects on the evolution of consciousness and the possible timing of language evolution. Behavior planning is presented as a model of language evolution from storytelling. The behavior programming mechanism in both directions provide a model of creating and understanding behavior and language. Culture began with societies, then family evolution, family life in troops, but storytelling created a culture of experiences, a final step in the long process of achieving experienced adults by natural selection.

To learn to make a communicative act, the brain must be able to dynamically associate arbitrary percepts to the neural substrate underlying the pre-requisite motor activity. We aimed to investigate whether brain regions involved in complex gestures (ventral pre-motor cortex, Brodmann Area 44) were involved in mediating association between novel abstract auditory stimuli and novel gestural movements. In a functional resonance imaging (fMRI) study we asked participants to learn associations between previously unrelated novel sounds and meaningless gestures inside the scanner. We use functional connectivity analysis to eliminate the often present confound of 'strategic covert naming' when dealing with BA44 and to rule out effects of non-specific reductions in signal. Brodmann Area 44, a region incorporating Broca's region showed strong, bilateral, negative correlation of BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) response with learning of sound-action associations during data acquisition. Left-inferior-parietal-lobule (l-IPL) and bilateral loci in and around visual area V5, right-orbital-frontal-gyrus, right-hippocampus, left-para-hippocampus, right-head-of-caudate, right-insula and left-lingual-gyrus also showed decreases in BOLD response with learning. Concurrent with these decreases in BOLD response, an increasing connectivity between areas of the imaged network as well as the right-middle-frontal-gyrus with rising learning performance was revealed by a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis. The increasing connectivity therefore occurs within an increasingly energy efficient network as learning proceeds. Strongest learning related connectivity between regions was found when analysing BA44 and l-IPL seeds. The results clearly show that BA44 and l-IPL is dynamically involved in linking gesture and sound and therefore provides evidence that one of the mechanisms required for the evolution of human communication is found within these motor regions.;Included;Excluded;Non-spontaneous communication;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

On stage, the representation of utopia is restricted since in theater, everything happens in the actors' and audience's 'here and now.' If theater cannot overcome this space and time restriction, how actors can render 'future' on stage through movement, gesture and voice remains one of the essential issues in bringing utopia to life on stage. This article examines utopian performatives in theater and methods used when modeling the notion of 'future' through acting. It analyzes Michael Chekhov's vision of an international theater comprehensible for any audience member of any national or linguistic origin as a utopian construct, drawing upon the example of the 1931 Paris production of Le chateau s'eveille: essai d'un drame rhythme [The Castle Awakening: An Essay in Rhythmical Drama].

22445032;wos387;Handedness in monkeys reflects hemispheric specialization within the central sulcus An in vivo MRI study in right- and left-handed olive baboons;"Margiotoudi K; Marie D; Claidiere N; Coulon O; Roth M; Nazarian B; Lacoste R; Hopkins WD; Molesti S; Fresnais P; Anton J L; Meguerditchian A";Journal Article;Handedness, one of the most prominent expressions of laterality, has been historically considered unique to human. This noteworthy feature relates to contralateral interhemispheric asymmetries in the motor hand area following the mid-portion of the central sulcus. However, within an evolutionary approach, it remains debatable whether hand preferences in nonhuman primates are associated with similar patterns of hemispheric specialization. In the present study conducted in Old world monkeys, we investigate anatomical asymmetries of the central sulcus in a sample of 86 olive baboons (Papio anubis) from in vivo T1 anatomical magnetic resonance images (MRI). Out of this sample, 35 individuals were classified as right-handed and 28 as left-handed according to their hand use responses elicited by a bimanual coordinated tube task. Here we report that the direction and degree of hand preference (left or right), as measured by this manual task, relates to and correlates with contralateral hemispheric sulcus depth asymmetry, within a mid-portion of the central sulcus. This neuroanatomical manifestation of handedness in baboons located in a region, which may correspond to the motor hand area, questions the phylogenetic origins of human handedness that may date back to their common ancestor, 25-40 millions years ago.

22445282;wos388;Contrast of hand preferences between communicative gestures and non-communicative actions in baboons: Implications for the origins of hemispheric specialization for language;"Meguerditchian A; Vauclair J";Journal Article;Gestural communication is a modality considered in the literature as a candidate for determining the ancestral prerequisites of the emergence of human language. As reported in captive chimpanzees and human children, a study in captive baboons revealed that a communicative gesture elicits stronger degree of right-hand bias than non-communicative actions. It remains unclear if it is the communicative nature of this manual behavior which induces such patterns of handedness. In the present study, we have measured hand use for two uninvestigated behaviors in a group of captive olive baboons: (1) a non-communicative self-touching behavior ('muzzle wipe' serving as a control behavior), (2) another communicative gesture (a ritualized 'food beg') different from the one previously studied in the literature (a species-specific threat gesture, namely 'hand slap') in the same population of baboons. The hand preferences for the 'food beg' gestures revealed a trend toward right-handedness and significantly correlated with the hand preferences previously reported in the hand slap gesture within the same baboons. By contrast, the hand preferences for the self-touching behaviors did not reveal any trend of manual bias at a group-level nor correlation with the hand preferences of any communicative gestures. These findings provide additional support to the hypothesized existence in baboons of a specific communicative system involved in the production of communicative gestures that may tend to a left-hemispheric dominance and that may differ from the system involved in purely motor functions. The hypothetical implications of these collective results are discussed within the theoretical framework about the origins of hemispheric specialization for human language. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

22445539;wos390;Origins of theory of mind, cognition and communication;Meltzoff AN;Journal Article;"There has been a revolution in our understanding of infant and toddler cognition that promises to have far-reaching implications for our understanding of communicative and linguistic development. Four empirical findings that helped to prompt this change in theory are analyzed: (a) Intermodal coordination-newborns operate with multimodal information, recognizing equivalences in information across sensory-modalities; (b) Imitation-newborns imitate the lip and tongue movements they see others perform; (c) Memory-young infants form long-lasting representations of perceived events and use these memories to generate motor productions after lengthy delays in novel contexts; (d) Theory of mind-by 18 months of age toddlers have adopted a theory of mind, reading below surface behavior to the goals and intentions in people's actions. This paper examines three views currently being offered in the literature to replace the classical framework of early cognitive development: modularity-nativism connectionism, and theory-theory. Arguments are marshaled to support the 'theory-theory' view. This view emphasizes a combination of innate structure and qualitative reorganization in children's thought based on input from the people and things in their culture. It is suggested that preverbal cognition forms a substrate for language acquisition and that analyzing cognition may enhance our understanding of certain disorders of communication.

22445382;wos392;Memory and foraging theory: chimpanzee utilization of optimality heuristics in the rank-order recovery of hidden foods;"Sayers K; Menzel C R";Journal Article;Many models from foraging theory and movement ecology assume that resources are encountered randomly. If food locations, types and values are retained in memory, however, search time could be significantly reduced, with concurrent effects on biological fitness. Despite this, little is known about what specific characteristics of foods, particularly those relevant to profitability, nonhuman animals can remember. Building upon previous observations, we hypothesized that chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, after observing foods being hidden in a large wooded test area they could not enter, and after long delays, would direct (through gesture and vocalization) experimentally naive humans to the reward locations in an order that could be predicted beforehand by the spatial and physical characteristics of those items. In the main experiment, various quantities of almonds, both in and out of shells and sealed in transparent bags, were hidden in the test area. The chimpanzees later directed searchers to those items in a nonrandom order related to quantity, shell presence/absence, and the distance they were hidden from the subject. The recovery sequences were closely related to the actual e/h (energy/handling time) profitability of the foods. Predicted recovery orders, based on the energetic value of almonds and independently measured, individual-specific expected pursuit and processing times, were closely related to observed recovery orders. We argue that the information nonhuman animals possess regarding their environment can be extensive, and that further comparative study is vital for incorporating realistic cognitive variables into models of foraging and movement.

Communicative persistence is associated with complex cognitive skills such as intentionality, because interactants modify their communication in response to another's understanding of their meaning. Here we show that two language-trained chimpanzees effectively use intentional gestures to coordinate with an experimentally naive human to retrieve hidden food, providing some of the most compelling evidence to date for the role of communicative flexibility in successful coordination in nonhumans. Both chimpanzees (named Panzee and Sherman) increase the rate of non-indicative gestures when the experimenter approaches the location of the hidden food. Panzee also elaborates her gestures in relation to the experimenter's pointing, which enables her to find food more effectively than Sherman. Communicative persistence facilitates effective communication during behavioural coordination and is likely to have been important in shaping language evolution.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Little research has considered how these conventions are retained and/or adapted as gestures are integrated into emerging sign language lexicons. Here we describe a set of five gestures that are used to convey negative meanings by both speakers and signers in a single community: the San Juan Quiahije municipality in Oaxaca, Mexico. We show that all of the form-meaning mappings present for non-signers are retained by signers as they integrate the gestures into their lexicon. Interestingly, additional meanings are mapped to the gesture forms by signers - a phenomenon that appears to originate with deaf signers in particular. In light of this evidence, we argue that accounts of `wholesale borrowing' of gestures into emerging sign languages is overly simplistic: signers evidently adapt gestures as they integrate them into their emerging lexicons.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

More specifically, we investigated the macaque's ability to communicate intentionally about the location of an unreachable hidden food reward in several contexts which differ by the human partner's attentional state. The experimenter displayed seven attentional states differing on the basis of body, head and gaze orientation. Our study validates several criteria of an intentional communication. We showed that macaques produce more pointing gestures when an audience, i.e. the human partner, is present than absent. We also revealed an adjustment of gaze alternation between the face of the experimenter and the hidden food reward according to several experimental conditions. However, in our study, macaques did not produce auditory attention-getting behaviours when the human partner was inattentive. Finally, only rough cues, i.e. presence, body and face orientation of the observer, seem to be taken into account by macaques.

This paper reviews various approaches and recent achievements in designing and prototyping of interfaces for tetraplegic people originating from Biocybernetics Laboratory AGH. After a short review of other available systems, three categories of activities of daily living (ADL)-supporting solutions are presented: input devices, control software, and stand-alone systems. As a result of testing other alternatives such as touchpad, tongue presspad, eye tracker, blow sensor, and direct sensor of brain electrical activity, joysticks were selected as preferable input devices. They are free from hygienic issues, tolerant to involuntary use or excessive force, and easily operable by using the chin or lips. The operational flexibility required for personalization of input devices is achieved with dedicated software defining the rules of interpretation of operators' motions. To adapt the final signal to the specificity of a supported human, the interpretation process takes into account the identification of gesture, its duration, and coincidence. The paper also presents two stand-alone systems dedicated to supporting the selected ADL. One of them is a smart interface for infrared-based remote control of home appliances, and the second is a joystick-based emulator of a computer mouse. Both devices provide a learning mode that allows for adaptation to the particular environment (i.e. set of devices to be controlled) and specific abilities of their human operator.;Excluded;NA;Neuro-atypical subjects;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For example, both gaining and losing complexity can support diversity-so how exactly does complexity influence the emergence of unique phenotypes? Here we address this question by examining how complexity underlies the diversity of elaborate visual displays in the avian clade Ramphastides (toucans and barbets). These species communicate in part by using body movement and colorful ornaments on the tail. We find that sexual size dimorphism predicts the evolution of one specific signal, the tail-cock gesture, implying that tail cocking is more likely to evolve under stronger sexual selection. We also discover process-level constraints on the evolution of complexity: signals are gained along a strict order of operations, where the tail-cock gesture arises before other colors and gestures. Yet virtually any signal can be lost at any time. As a result, many extant phenotypes were more likely to arise through loss of complexity, highlighting the importance of secondary signal loss to phenotypic diversity. Collectively, our results demonstrate how sexual selection catalyzes the evolution of complex phenotypes, which indirectly support diversity by allowing different traits to be modified or lost in the future.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Integrated visual displays that combine gesture with colour are nearly ubiquitous in the animal world, where they are shaped by sexual selection for their role in courtship and competition. However, few studies assess how multiple selection regimens operate on different components of these complex phenotypes on a macroevolutionary scale.
2. Here, we study this issue by assessing how both sexual and ecological selection work together to influence visual display complexity in the birds of paradise.
3. We first find that sexual dichromatism is highest in lekking species, which undergo more intense sexual selection by female choice, than non-lekking species. At the same time, species in which males directly compete with one another at communal display courts have more carotenoid-based ornaments and fewer melanin ornaments.
4. Meanwhile, display habitat influences gestural complexity. Species that dance in the cluttered understorey have more complex dances than canopy-displaying species.
5. Taken together, our results illustrate how distinct selection regimens each operate on individual elements comprising a complex display.

Students from a culturally diverse cohort were taught how to interpret emotions in animated films and produced 2-D cartoon animations using drawings with an iPad application and stylus. The findings show that impassioned multimodal communication is enhanced by knowledge of how feelings produce different facial expressions, gestures, body movements, and physiological changes in characters that are often exaggerated to powerful effect in animations. This includes an ability to invoke different intensities of emotions.

The core of this musical tool consists of a low cost, highly functional computational model developed upon the Max/MSP platform that (1) captures real-time movement of the human body into a 3D coordinate system on the basis of the orientation output of any type of inertial sensor system that is OSC-compatible, (2) extract low-level movement features that specify the amount of contraction/expansion as a measure of how a subject uses the surrounding space, (3) recognizes these movement features as being expressive gestures, and (4) creates a mapping trajectory between these expressive gestures and the sound synthesis process of adding harmonic related voices on an in origin monophonic voice. The concern for a user-oriented and intuitive mapping strategy was thereby of central importance. This was achieved by conducting an empirical experiment based on theoretical concepts from the embodied music cognition paradigm.

On a mentalistic principle, he does not shy away from comparing the pointing gesture to language and from defining the deictic gesture as ontogenetic and phylogenetic earliest form of specific human cooperative communication. This article initially shows that the expression-theoretical construction of the research program creates contradictions and circularities. With reference to Karl Miler's works, a semiotic analysis of Tomasello's examples of the special quality of pointing gestures is provided. This approach also casts a new light on Tomasello's explanation of the transition to verbal language and argues that Tomasello's theoretical construction hardly yields reliable statements according to social interaction as a process and to the emergence of cognitive capacities and communication means, but that his findings on the actual cognitive capacities of children and nonhuman primates could additionally be taken into account to unlock the secret of the origins of language.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Yet there are clearly facial expressions and gestures that are commonly labeled 'flirting behaviors.' These nonverbal signals have been documented recently by several investigators in field studies, but the receptivity of nonverbal courtship signals is still in question. The current research project attempted to assess the perceptual skill of naive male and female observers who were presented videotaped samples of females' nonverbal courtship and rejection behaviors and asked to rate their intensity. The results showed that overall, men rated invitational behaviors more positively than women. In contrast, signals of rejection were seen by men as sending a less potent message than that perceived by women. Evolutionary theory may offer a framework for understanding these results.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445248;wos408;Convergent minds: ostension, inference and Grice's third clause;Moore R;Journal Article;A prevailing view is that while human communication has an 'ostensive-inferential' or 'Gricean' intentional structure, animal communication does not. This would make the psychological states that support human and animal forms of communication fundamentally different. Against this view, I argue that there are grounds to expect ostensive communication in non-human clades. This is because it is sufficient for ostensive communication that one intentionally addresses one's utterance to one's intended interlocutor-something that is both a functional pre-requisite of successful communication and cognitively undemanding. Furthermore, while ostension is an important feature of intentional communication, the inferences required in Gricean communication may be minimal: ostension and inference may come apart. The grounds for holding that animal communication could not be Gricean are therefore weak. I finish by defending the idea that a 'minimally Gricean' model of communication is avaluable tool for characterizing the communicative interactions of many animal species.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A consequence of this Cooperative Communication View is that Gricean communication could not itself contribute to an explanation of the possibility of joint action. I argue that even though Gricean communication is often a form of joint action, it is not necessarily so-since it does not always require intentional action on the part of a hearer. Rejecting the Cooperative Communication View has attractive consequences for our theorising about human cognitive development, since it opens up the possibility of appealing to communicative interaction to explain the emergence of joint action in phylogeny.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

According to one influential school of thought, we do this because we possess a uniquely human ability to act with and attribute 'Gricean' communicative intentions. A challenge for this view is that attributing communicative intent seems to require cognitive abilities that infant language learners lack. After considering a range of responses to this challenge, I argue that infant language development can be explained, because Gricean communication is cognitively less demanding than many suppose.

While the existence of different underlying mechanisms cannot be ruled out, in fact claims about difference are driven less by empirical data than by contested assumptions about the nature of ostensive communication.

23080838;wos412;High-level programming and control for industrial robotics: using a hand-held accelerometer-based input device for gesture and posture recognition;"Neto P; Pires JN; Moreira AP";Journal Article;"Purpose - Most industrial robots are still programmed using the typical teaching process, through the use of the robot teach pendant. This is a tedious and time-consuming task that requires some technical expertise, and hence new approaches to robot programming are required. The purpose of this paper is to present a robotic system that allows users to instruct and program a robot with a high-level of abstraction from the robot language.
Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents in detail a robotic system that allows users, especially non-expert programmers, to instruct and program a robot just showing it what it should do, in an intuitive way. This is done using the two most natural human interfaces (gestures and speech), a force control system and several code generation techniques. Special attention will be given to the recognition of gestures, where the data extracted from a motion sensor (three-axis accelerometer) embedded in the Wii remote controller was used to capture human hand behaviours. Gestures (dynamic hand positions) as well as manual postures (static hand positions) are recognized using a statistical approach and artificial neural networks.
Findings - It is shown that the robotic system presented is suitable to enable users without programming expertise to rapidly create robot programs. The experimental tests showed that the developed system can be customized for different users and robotic platforms.
Research limitations/implications - The proposed system is tested on two different robotic platforms. Since the options adopted are mainly based on standards, it can be implemented with other robot controllers without significant changes. Future work will focus on improving the recognition rate of gestures and continuous gesture recognition. Practical implications The key contribution of this paper is that it offers a practical method to program robots by means of gestures and speech, improving work efficiency and saving time.
Originality/value - This paper presents an alternative to the typical robot teaching process, extending the concept of human-robot interaction and co-worker scenario. Since most companies do not have engineering resources to make changes or add new functionalities to their robotic manufacturing systems, this system constitutes a major advantage for small- to medium-sized enterprises.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We have used simultaneous physiological and anatomical measurements to investigate the issue. Concentrating on neural oscillatory activity in speech-specific frequency bands and exploring interactions between gestural (motor) and auditory-evoked activity, we find, in the absence of language-related processing, that left auditory, somatosensory, articulatory motor, and inferior parietal cortices show specific, lateralized, speech-related physiological properties. With the addition of ecologically valid audiovisual stimulation, activity in auditory cortex synchronizes with left-dominant input from the motor cortex at frequencies corresponding to syllabic, but not phonemic, speech rhythms. Our results support theories of language lateralization that posit a major role for intrinsic, hardwired perceptuomotor processing in syllabic parsing and are compatible both with the evolutionary view that speech arose from a combination of syllable-sized vocalizations and meaningful hand gestures and with developmental observations suggesting phonemic analysis is a developmentally acquired process.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445368;wos414;Monkeys are perceptually tuned to facial expressions that exhibit a theta-like speech rhythm;"Ghazanfar A A; Morrill R J; Kayser C";Journal Article;Human speech universally exhibits a 3- to 8-Hz rhythm, corresponding to the rate of syllable production, which is reflected in both the sound envelope and the visual mouth movements. Artificial perturbation of the speech rhythm outside the natural range reduces speech intelligibility, demonstrating a perceptual tuning to this frequency band. One theory posits that the mouth movements at the core of this speech rhythm evolved through modification of ancestral primate facial expressions. Recent evidence shows that one such communicative gesture in macaque monkeys, lip-smacking, has motor parallels with speech in its rhythmicity, its developmental trajectory, and the coordination of vocal tract structures. Whether monkeys also exhibit a perceptual tuning to the natural rhythms of lip-smacking is unknown. To investigate this, we tested rhesus monkeys in a preferential-looking procedure, measuring the time spent looking at each of two side-by-side computer-generated monkey avatars lip-smacking at natural versus sped-up or slowed-down rhythms. Monkeys showed an overall preference for the natural rhythm compared with the perturbed rhythms. This lends behavioral support for the hypothesis that perceptual processes in monkeys are similarly tuned to the natural frequencies of communication signals as they are in humans. Our data provide perceptual evidence for the theory that speech may have evolved from ancestral primate rhythmic facial expressions.;Included;Excluded;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To evaluate the role of language in the social transmission of lithic technology, we designed and developed an experimental protocol through which we compared the acquisition of knapping skills in thirty non-experts in the early stages of learning, by means of three mechanisms of social transmission: imitation-emulation, gestural communication, and verbal communication. All the apprentice knappers carried out the experimental task with blanks that were equal in shape and size, and were requested to replicate what the expert knapper was doing: the alternating method, a sufficiently simple, but systematic technique for detaching flakes from a core. We analysed each participant's actions, including those of the master knapper, the final products ( flakes and cores), and the knapping sequences, by analysing the refits. Our results show that the apprentices improved their knapping skills in teaching conditions-both gestural and verbal communication-, and specially through the latter. In conclusion, our study supports the hypothesis of co-evolution between lithic technology and social learning, which could have favoured the emergence of verbal language.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These differences may in turn contribute to core interspecies differences in higher-order cognitive functions, not only for bodily imitation but for action understanding through complex referential information from faces, sharing symbols, and language. This 'developmental-comparative' approach reveals the development of species-specific intelligences, and shows what is shared and not shared between humans and other primates.

22445597;wos422;Workshop of artistic expression: the subtext search in the author's text;Nadiya G;Journal Article;"The author, guided by her own experience, reveals the essence of phenomena 'subtext' as a creative process of a stage speech teacher and novice actor cooperation. Using the literary works of Ukrainian authors as an example she proves that revealing the hidden meanings of composition by the artist depends on his educational and intellectual level, imagination, fantasy, intuition, and associative thinking. The author argues that the work on the implication develops logical thinking and tonal expressiveness of the actor.
The attempt to consider the subtext as a phenomenon is based on the researches of linguists, philologists, psychologists, Ukrainian playwrights, directors, actors, critics and teachers. Obtained after detailed study of all these sources data was used to form the structure of our exploration.
The article contains the process of hard and long work on composition. During the cognition of authorship work the main objectives are to identify themes, ideas, plot, story, composition, nature of the conflict, genre. Penetration into the language structure of the text, gives the opportunity to understand the author's intent. After a detailed analysis, the actor begins the work on its implementation, that provides a logical and effective analyses, definition of objectives, which stimulates creative thought, creative activity, and this the manifestation of his life position. At this stage the performer penetrates into the essence of the text, experiences described by the author events, fills them with his personal attitudes, concepts as the figurative views, that would help in revealing the subtext.
The study fully describes the characteristics of an actor's work implication in the process of artistic expression of the author's text. The author of the article proves that the subtext is a good way for actor to strengthen the semantic colouring of the work. In addition, the subtexts, as internal agents, are forced to pronounce the text and cause by the need to act in a word, help him discover the essence of the work. It is vital to note here that the work with the subtexts develops logical thinking and intonational expressiveness of the actor. The subtext is expressed by the intonations, in the subtlest of rhythm-the melodic and the tonal nuances of speech, eloquence psychological pauses in the expression and the gleam in his eyes, MMI the game faces, gestures, tempo of speech. Subtext and evaluation in such circumstances is born by themselves.
The study highlights and explains the difference in meaning of 'subtext' for the author of the artwork and actor. For the author of an artistic work, the subtext is a good way to strengthen the semantic colouring works. With its help he manages to more deeply convey sadness or joy, the absurdity of a given situation, to express derision, irony. The author of the article focuses on the challenges facing the actor in the work: to find out the true meaning of the author in the text and convey that meaning using existing creative tools, to fill his personal attitude and evaluation. It means not to accept the views expressed in the text of thoughts and feelings in a ready form, but to rethink them, to endure, to survive. Extremely important is the actor's ability to reach deep ideological and psychological understanding of the author, all of the artistic features and characteristics of the work, in order to convey this to the audience. The text will remain dead until the actor brings to life its contents in my mind.
However, the only imagination is not enough, the actor must make the language of the characters as his own language. The author of the study emphasizes the need for a beginning actor to learn to be observant in life: in appreciation of works of art, of reality; to remember exciting details in nature, in life, in relationships people, to try to see them with inner vision. Unsaid in the text of the author's thoughts should be supplemented by pictures and details that draws their own imagination. Such searches of the author's text subtext attain a lively sound: verbal, tonal, plastic.
Examples of literary works of Ukrainian authors (the poem 'Good people Puchica S., excerpt from 'Four fords'. Stelmakh) argue that the revealing of subtext of the artwork by the actor depends on their educational and intellectual level, imagination, fantasy, intuition and associative thinking.
Particular attention is focused on the main task of the actor in the text - to reveal the nature and psychological nature of every detail. In addition, the description of a novice actor work on creative imagination plays an important role in the article, as important express means of the illustrated subtext.

It should be noted that in the disclosure of the subtext the significant place is given to the imagination, as it applies actor's emotional attitude to the events.



On the basis of their own theoretical and practical knowledge, the author argues that the way to reveal the subtext is through the accumulation and reinterpretation of visions, and also through the line of relations and values, which are manifested in the intonational expressiveness of actor's voice. It is the intonation that affects the listener, the actor is seeking a positive reaction - understanding of the work by the listener. The implementation of the relevant existing tasks allows the actor to feel the same when the structure of the phrase will change logical melody, and with it the intonation of speech.



During the research the author claims that only with the professional analysis of the author's text and deep penetration into the inner essence of the words - the subtext, the actor will fill the artwork with life, truth, illustrated by vivid visions, which he at the time of stage performances will generously share with the listener.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Conference on Imitation and Socio-Emotional Process - Implications for Communicative Development Interventions
The functional maturity of the newborn infant's brain, the resemblances between neonatal imitation and imitation in adults and the possibly lateralized neonatal imitation suggest that the mirror neuron system may contribute to neonatal imitation. Newborn infants not only imitate but also initiate previously imitated gestures, and are able to participate in overlapping imitation-initiation communicative cycles. Additionally, these social responses in neonates are faster than previously thought, and may enable them to have long-lasting intimate interactions much before language develops. Infants are equipped with a powerful, innate, reciprocal communicative ability already at birth. The earliest communication originates from imitation and this communicative ability presumably later evolves to language.

In this case, contact with Hebrew, used solely as a 'hierolect' (a language serving only sacred and ritual purposes), provides much of the lexical material. However, these 'Hebraisms', semantically unrelated to the source language, cannot be regarded as loanwords, for they are built through delocutivity from liturgical acts of speech.

METHODS: Translation of GBT into Portuguese was performed by a rheumatologist fluent in the language of origin (French) and skilled in the validation of questionnaires. This translated version was back-translated into French by a native-speaking teacher of the language. The two translators then created a final consensual version in Portuguese. Cultural adaptation was carried out by two rheumatologists, one educated patient and the native-speaking French teacher. Thirty patients with chronic low back pain and fifteen healthcare professionals involved in the education of patients with low back pain through back schools (gold-standard) were evaluated. Reproducibility was initially tested by two observers (inter-observer); the procedures were also videotaped for later evaluation by one of the observers (intra-observer). For construct validation, we compared patients' scores against the scores of the healthcare professionals.
RESULTS: Modifications were made to the GBT for cultural reasons. The Spearman's correlation coefficient and the intra-class coefficient, which was employed to measure reproducibility, ranged between 0.87 and 0.99 and 0.94 to 0.99, respectively (p < 0.01). With regard to validation, the Mann-Whitney test revealed a significant difference (p < 0.01) between the averages for healthcare professionals (26.60; SD 2.79) and patients (16.30; SD 6.39). There was a positive correlation between the GBT score and the score on the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (r=0.47).

This 'iconization in graphic adaptation is a mirroring and a ghostification.

Today, this process utilizes the graphic language and representational modes of the digital medium and is therefore transmedial. Maps of literary influence, built through software, graphic visualizations of literary texts. In the third section, the essay argues that the work of criticism in the digital age gestures at the contexts and processes outside the task and textual frame, and to signs and symbols within it.

22445401;wos428;Speech perception as pattern recognition;Nearey TM;Journal Article;"Conference:
129th Meeting of the Acoustical-Society-of-America
This work provides theoretical and empirical arguments in favor of an approach to phonetics that is called double-weak. It is so called because it assumes relatively weak constraints both on the articulatory gestures and on the auditory patterns that map phonological elements. This approach views speech production and perception as distinct but cooperative systems. Like the motor theory of speech perception, double-weak theory accepts that phonological units are modified by context in ways that are important to perception. It further agrees that many aspects of such context dependency have their origin in natural articulatory processes. However, double-weak theory sides with proponents of auditory theories of phonetics by accepting that the real-time objects of perception are well-defined auditory patterns. Because speakers find ways to obey ''orderly output conditions'' (Sussman et al., 1995), listeners are able to successfully decode speech using relatively simple pattern-recognition mechanisms. It is suggested that this situation has arisen through a stylization of gestural patterns to accommodate real-time limits of the perceptual system. Results from a new perceptual experiment, involving a four-dimensional stimulus continuum and a 10-category/hVC/response set, are shown to be largely compatible with this framework.

22445758;wos430;The modern measurement of Tchaikovsky (definition experience of the 'modernity' concept on example of the 'children's album' by P I Tchaikovsky);Nekhaeva IN;Journal Article;The definition of the term 'modernity' is an important part of the functioning of contemporary art. According to the definitions of J.-F. Lyotard and T. de Duve, modernity and post-modernity are two states dependent on each other, it allows us to outline the way of changes in the struggle of 'modernity' for survival and prestige. We can made several comparisons to try answer to question of what postmodern trends are already outlined in the period of Tchaikovsky's writing 'Children's Album'. Firstly, it arises an authentic space for solving certain language tasks of this music cycle. It concerns the participation of Tchaikovsky (as well as many of his contemporaries, the 'Mighty Handful' composers in particular) in becoming of so-called 'the linguistic turn' (in 1920s), and allows us to draw a parallel with ideas of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Recognition of the main junctions between the works of Tchaikovsky and Wittgenstein seems to be important, these include not just their mutual desire for the utmost precision of language, but also the clarity of their emotional expression, and the role of emotional certainty in teaching children both music and language. Secondly, the emergence of 'modernity' reveals the role of tradition, which is not discarded as useless, but is the ground for struggle between the 'old' and the 'new'. An unusual example of this is still the questions posed by M. Mesropova and A. Kandinsky-Rybnikov in the article 'On unpublished first edition of the 'Children's Album' by P.I. Tchaikovsky'. The assumption that they made is indicating the composer's desire to substantially simplify the musical material, in order to spare the child's vulnerable soul, but that is clearly not enough for scientific reasoning. The idea that inconsistencies in alternation of numbers of the 'Autograph' (original) and 'Publications' (subsequent editions) of this music cycle were caused only by the publishers error, is generally absurd. It would be more correct to follow the setting of Ludwig Wittgenstein ('nothing is hidden'), seeing in this gesture of the composer a natural desire to overcome the temporary barrier and directly appeal to future generations of musicians. Later, something similar will be done by Marcel Duchamp in the fine arts. At the exhibition of the American Society of Independent Artists in April 1917 he not only exhibits one of his ready-made object (so-called 'Fountain'), but afterward creates many replicas or copies of this non-handmading object. The goal of both provocations is not only creation of an artwork as a thing, but rather demonstration of an art-idea, fixing of which is carried out through introduction of an ambiguous situation inevitably entailed to a conflict of interpretations.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445685;wos431;An emotional roller-coaster: The materialization of passion in 18th-century acting and gardening;Nelle F;Journal Article;Around the middle of the 18th century both gardening, formerly considered as a part of architecture, and acting, formerly not considered to be an art at all, come to be regarded as distinctive and specific forms of art. Supposed to be most closely related to the materiality of nature in general and the human body in particular they also seem to be best suited to represent and convey emotions. Through the discourse on gardening and acting, which unfolds amidst a series of binary oppositions such as nature vs. culture, original vs. copy, gardening vs. painting, gesture vs. language, the garden and the body of the actor emerge as idealized spaces which allow to organize the confusing and complex network of subtle emotional difference supposed to be the quintessence of culture and humanity. This leads to the creation of theatrical garden scenes which seek to integrate landscape, classical literature and the passions according to dramatic principles. In the case of acting the corresponding discourse culminates in the ideal of an emotional roller-coaster, a series of rapidly changing contradictory emotions which can by no means be sympathetically experienced by the audience. The emotional overkill reduces the effect of acting to the dimension of mere movement. The audience splits into the connoisseurs, who admire the artistic excellence of the actor, and those who caught by the spectacle experience an unspecific emotion. Consequently, romantic theory locates the emotion in an intermediate space between the work of art and the imagination of the audience. Still, the moralizing distinction between the direct expression of sincere emotions and evil passions subsists as a legal problem until nowadays.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445468;wos432;Laughter as gesture: Hilarity and the anti-sublime;Nichols S G;Journal Article;Why should laughter not possess 'meaning' just like other forms of human articulation? It does use the same organs as speech: face, mouth, voice, diaphragm, breath, and so on. Yet the enigma and exasperation of laughter arise from the impossibility of parsing risible meaning. In short, laughter disturbs precisely by its ambiguity, its ability to send a meaningless message. It raises the issue of cognition but then veers off into (non-rational) bodily expression: in short laughter-as-gesture. If Kant first noted this dynamic, it was Schopenhauer, following Jean Paul, who reflected most deeply on it. Max Kommerell's groundbreaking book on Jean Paul (1933), recognizing the originality of these thinkers, conceptualized Gebarde 'gesture' as a means of expressing the ego through the body without recourse to language (Ichgefuhl). Laughter is one of the most complex manifestations of Ichgefuhl. This insight extends key aspects of insights Nietzsche formulated in. Also sprach Zarathustra. All of these meditations postulate variations on the bodily grotesque as a non-conceptual meeting of corporeal being with an unmasked and chaotic world.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this article we first update sociocognitive theory in light of recent evolutionary/ecological research on learning/teaching: (a) Humans are evolutionarily adapted to adapt to myriad environments, placing a premium on adaptive learning, (b) human adaptation is effected substantially through niche construction-engineering environments to make them more adaptive, and then transmitting the results culturally, placing a premium on adaptive teaching, (c) both human learning and teaching are innate/instinctive, and co-evolved, and (d) there are many kinds of 'teachers' in the world. Second, we briefly review 3 approaches to second language acquisition/teaching (SLA/T) vis-a-vis sociocognitive theory: van Lier's ecological-semiotic approach, Schumann's interactional instinct, and conversation analysis. Third, we apply our theoretical perspective exploratorily to videotaped data of a Japanese learner/user of English as a lingua franca who is baking pastries with a Finnish friend. Our analysis includes 5 widely studied 'units of participation' :activity types, routines, co-constructed tellings, repetition, and assessments. Analysis suggests that these constitute powerful environmental support structures yielding rich learning opportunities for SLA/T in moment-to-moment interaction. Fourth and finally, we discuss our results vis-a-vis our theoretical approach.

22445041;wos435;Population-Specific Use of the Same Tool-Assisted Alarm Call between Two Wild Orangutan Populations (Pongopygmaeus wurmbii) Indicates Functional Arbitrariness;"Lameira A R; Hardus M E; Nouwen K J; Topelberg E;   Delgado RA; Spruijt B M; Sterck EHM; Knott CD; Wich S A;";Journal Article;Arbitrariness is an elementary feature of human language, yet seldom an object of comparative inquiry. While arbitrary signals for the same function are relatively frequent between animal populations across taxa, the same signal with arbitrary functions is rare and it remains unknown whether, in parallel with human speech, it may involve call production in animals. To investigate this question, we examined a particular orangutan alarm call - the kiss-squeak - and two variants - hand and leaf kiss-squeaks. In Tuanan (Central Kalimantan, Indonesia), the acoustic frequency of unaided kiss-squeaks is negatively related to body size. The modified variants are correlated with perceived threat and are hypothesized to increase the perceived body size of the sender, as the use of a hand or leaves lowers the kiss-squeak's acoustic frequency. We examined the use of these variants in the same context in another orangutan population of the same sub-species and with partially similar habitat at Cabang Panti (West Kalimantan, Indonesia). Identical analyses of data from this site provided similar results for unaided kiss-squeaks but dissimilar results for hand and leaf kiss-squeaks. Unaided kiss-squeaks at Cabang Panti were emitted as commonly and showed the same relationship to body size as in Tuanan. However, at Cabang Panti, hand kiss-squeaks were extremely rare, while leaf-use neither conveyed larger body size nor was related to perceived threat. These findings indicate functional discontinuity between the two sites and therefore imply functional arbitrariness of leaf kiss-squeaks. These results show for the first time the existence of animal signals involving call production with arbitrary function. Our findings are consistent with previous studies arguing that these orangutan call variants are socially learned and reconcile the role of gestures and calls within evolutionary theories based on common ancestry for speech and music.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This convergence has been systematized in a (consonantal) acoustic dimension partially independent from the original (vocalic) dimensions of contrast for which the rounding and palatal articulations were specified. These conclusions are based on an examination of distributional patterns, palatograms of the articulation of secondarily articulated consonants, and acoustic analyses. Contrastiveness and quantal considerations can be seen as contributing to the occurrence of typologically odd sounds, provided one keeps in mind how an articulatory gesture functions within a language's contrastive system.*;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23080784;wos441;Full body movements recognition - unsupervised learning approach with heuristic R-GDL method;"Hachaj T; Ogiela MR";Journal Article;In computer systems that are used for actions recognition the human movements are often represented by three-dimensional coordinates of body joints that are tracked by motion capture hardware. The motivation of our research was to propose a novel method for automatic generation of knowledge base for syntactic Gesture Description Language (GDL) classifier by analyzing unsegmented data recordings of gestures. We have proposed novel unsupervised learning approach to deal with this task. Because this process seems to be reverse engineering to GDL approach, the learning algorithm we introduce in this paper, is called Revers-GDL (R-GDL). The R-GDL machine-learning approach for full-body movements recognition is a novel method of time-varying multidimensional signals classification. The description of R-GDL and its validation is our original and never before published achievement. The evaluation of R-GDL was performed with k-fold cross validation on large dataset that contains 770 complete movements samples of 9 gym exercises performed by 14 persons and compared with results from multivariate normally continuous density hidden Markov model classifier. Depending on exercise type GDL obtained recognition rate at the level of 100% to 91%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

22445635;wos442;Mind the gap - moving beyond the dichotomy between intentional gestures and emotional facial and vocal signals of nonhuman primates;"Liebal K; Ona L";Journal Article;Despite the variety of theories suggesting how human language might have evolved, very few consider the potential role of emotions in such scenarios. The few existing theories jointly highlight that gaining control over the production of emotional communication was crucial for establishing and maintaining larger social groups. This in turn resulted in the development of more complex social emotions and the corresponding sophisticated socio-cognitive skills to understand others' communicative behavior, providing the grounds for language to emerge. Importantly, these theories propose that the ability of controlling emotional communication is a uniquely human trait, an assumption that we will challenge. By taking a comparative approach, we discuss recent findings from behavioral and neurobiological studies from our closest relatives, the non-human primates, on the extent of control over their gestural, facial and vocal signals. This demonstrates that research foci differ drastically across these modalities, which further enhances the traditional dichotomy between emotional, involuntary facial and vocal expressions in contrast to intentionally, voluntarily produced gestures. Based on this brief overview, we point to gaps of knowledge in primate communication research and suggest how investigating emotional expressions in our closest relatives might enrich the road map towards the evolution of human language.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445295;wos443;Development of a Serial Order in Speech Constrained by Articulatory Coordination;"Oohashi H; Watanabe H; Taga G";Journal Article;Universal linguistic constraints seem to govern the organization of sound sequences in words. However, our understanding of the origin and development of these constraints is incomplete. One possibility is that the development of neuromuscular control of articulators acts as a constraint for the emergence of sequences in words. Repetitions of the same consonant observed in early infancy and an increase in variation of consonantal sequences over months of age have been interpreted as a consequence of the development of neuromuscular control. Yet, it is not clear how sequential coordination of articulators such as lips, tongue apex and tongue dorsum constrains sequences of labial, coronal and dorsal consonants in words over the course of development. We examined longitudinal development of consonant-vowel-consonant(-vowel) sequences produced by Japanese children between 7 and 60 months of age. The sequences were classified according to places of articulation for corresponding consonants. The analyses of individual and group data show that infants prefer repetitive and fronting articulations, as shown in previous studies. Furthermore, we reveal that serial order of different places of articulations within the same organ appears earlier and then gradually develops, whereas serial order of different articulatory organs appears later and then rapidly develops. In the same way, we also analyzed the sequences produced by English children and obtained similar developmental trends. These results suggest that the development of intra-and inter-articulator coordination constrains the acquisition of serial orders in speech with the complexity that characterizes adult language.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Once the publisher's authorization was given, the process of translation and back-translation of the protocol was initiated, adapting it to sociocultural aspects, such as expressions. names, and adequate examples in Brazilian Portuguese. In order to investigate the internal reliability of the translation process, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used. The second stage was a pilot study, in which the questionnaire was applied to 43 parents of children from 24 to 47 months old from a city in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The results were analyzed according to the total score and to the subscales of the questionnaire. 'Me variables age range and parental level of education were also analyzed. Results: The analysis using the Cronbach's alpha coefficient showed high internal consistency (alpha>0,98) in almost all the subscales which means that the instrument adapted to Brazilian Portuguese can be used. In the pilot study, an age effect was found in the total score and in the LUI subscale scores, i.e., the older the children, the fewer gestures they used, with more words and syntactic constructions. Conclusion: The Brazilian-Portuguese version of the LUI questionnaire seems to be a reliable translation of the original and a reliable instrument to evaluate preschoolers' language pragmatics. After future detailed analyses, it will allow early diagnosis and intervention in children with language disorders.;Included;Excluded;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

23080788;wos446;Mismatch negativity (MMN) to speech sounds is modulated systematically by manual grip execution;"Tiainen M; Tiippana K; Paavilainen P; Vainio M; Vainio L";Journal Article;Manual actions and speech are connected: for example, grip execution can influence simultaneous vocalizations and vice versa. Our previous studies show that the consonant [k] is associated with the power grip and the consonant [t] with the precision grip. Here we studied whether the interaction between speech sounds and grips could operate already at a pre-attentive stage of auditory processing, reflected by the mismatch-negativity (MMN) component of the event-related potential (ERP). Participants executed power and precision grips according to visual cues while listening to syllable sequences consisting of [ke] and [te] utterances. The grips modulated the MMN amplitudes to these syllables in a systematic manner so that when the deviant was [ke], the MMN response was larger with a precision grip than with a power grip. There was a converse trend when the deviant was [te]. These results suggest that manual gestures and speech can interact already at a pre-attentive processing level of auditory perception, and show, for the first time that manual actions can systematically modulate the MMN.

22445695;wos447;The Development of Symbolic Uses of Objects in Infants in a Triadic Context: A Pragmatic and Semiotic Perspective;"Palacios P; Rodriguez C";Journal Article;In this study, we address the construction of the first symbolic uses of objects in contexts of triadic interaction (adult-child-object). We assume that symbolic productions are based on public rules of the use of objects previously agreed by the community. The first symbols are not rooted in any literal, evident reality, but in shared rules of uses about the material world. We observed six dyads communicating and interacting together with 10 objects in a semi-structured situation longitudinally from 9 to 15months of age. We found that the infants gradually constructed symbolic meanings, and we identified five symbolic levels and sublevels. At 9months, the infants attended and engaged in the symbolic uses produced by an adult even though they themselves were not yet able to produce them. At 12months, infants began to use objects symbolically to communicate with adults. The highest percentage of these first symbolic uses was of level 1, that is, with a close relation to the conventional use of the object used to perform the symbol. At 15months, children increased their symbolic uses and performed symbolic uses at all levels, whereas adults reduced such practices. Adult semiotic mediation and the social meanings of objects can be considered important factors in children's symbolic productions.

22445167;wos448;Sharing the motivation to play: the use of signals in adult bonobos;Palagi E;Journal Article;Gestures and facial displays are involved in regulating many aspects of mammal social life such as aggression, dominance-subordinate relationships, appeasement and play. Playful activity is an interesting behaviour for examining the role of signals as intentional communication systems. When animals play they perform patterns that are used in other serious contexts. To avoid miscommunication, many species have evolved signals to maintain a playful mood. Bonobos, Pan paniscus, with their flexible social relationships and playful propensity, may represent a good model species to test some hypotheses on adult play signalling. I analysed the potential roles of facial play expressions and solitary play in soliciting and regulating social play and found that adult bonobos used the play face (relaxed open-mouth display) in a selective manner. Play faces were more frequent during social than solitary play and, within social play, polyadic sessions (even though less frequent than dyadic sessions) were characterized by a higher frequency of signals following the rule of play intensity matching, play faces were more frequent when the two players matched in age and size (sessions among adults). Moreover, among dyads there was a positive correlation between the frequency of aggressive interactions performed and the frequency of play signals used, thus suggesting that signals are crucial in play negotiations among individuals showing high baseline levels of aggression finally, solitary play, especially when it involved pirouettes and somersaults, had an important role in triggering social play.

The transition from non-linguistic creatures to linguistic ones may have required the conjunction of social-affective brain mechanisms, morphological changes in the articulatory apparatus, an abundance of cross-modal cortical processing ability, and the initial urge to communicate in coordinate prosodic gestural and vocal ways, which may have been more poetic and musical than current propositional language.

Human beings, however, use publicly available information flexibly in many different contexts including assessing others' altruistic tendencies, which may in turn inform their choice of the most appropriate cooperative partner. We assessed whether dogs, Canis familiaris, were capable of discerning a generous versus selfish food-sharing interaction between humans, and investigated which communicative cues (voice versus gestures) may be more salient for them. Importantly a control condition was included to ascertain whether it was in fact the interaction between individuals as opposed to the direct actions of the actors that the dogs evaluated. We found that the dogs were capable of eavesdropping on human food-sharing interactions, and vocal communication was particularly important to convey the human's cooperative versus noncooperative intent.

Some of these behaviors, such as the capacity of neonates to imitate adult facial movements, were previously thought to be limited to humans and perhaps the ape lineage. Here we report the behavioral responses of infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) to the following human facial and hand gestures: lip smacking, tongue protrusion, mouth opening, hand opening, and opening and closing of eyes (control condition). In the third day of life, infant macaques imitate lip smacking and tongue protrusion. On the first day of life, the model's mouth openings elicited a similar matched behavior (lip smacking) in the infants. These imitative responses are present at an early stage of development, but they are apparently confined to a narrow temporal window. Because lip smacking is a core gesture in face-to-face interactions in macaques, neonatal imitation may serve to tune infants' affiliative responses to the social world. Our findings provide a quantitative description of neonatal imitation in a nonhuman primate species and suggest that these imitative capacities, contrary to what was previously thought, are not unique to the ape and human lineage. We suggest that their evolutionary origins may be traced to affiliative gestures with communicative functions.;Included;Excluded;Non-spontaneous communication;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Conference on Gesture in the Mediterranean
Emblems or emblematic gestures have been recognized as a category or type of gesture in many studies, ever since the pioneering work by Efron (1941) and the well-known typology of Ekman and Friesen (1969). In the Mediterranean area, the study of characteristic emblems shows very different patterns of combinations of linguistic and cultural features, and also of transference or interference between emblems as conventional communicative signals, which may be intimately associated with linguistic varieties and/or cultural backgrounds. The case of the linguistic and cultural contact between Catalan and Spanish offers some interesting tokens of this kind, which can serve as the starting-point for research into emblems throughout the Mediterranean region. The resulting distribution of the historical evolution of the same original emblems and verbal expressions on the one hand and recent borrowings on the other makes the Mediterranean region a particularly interesting laboratory for the analysis of multimodal communicative acts. The distribution patterns of emblems depend on factors such as historical origin, geographical spread, and their relation to verbal items. With regard to the last factor, some emblems seem to have been created from idiomatic expressions, but many others have a clear cultural basis, and are not so closely linked to spoken language.";Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We provide a detailed description of the implementation of these dimensions in our animation system, including our gesture modeling language.

Various studies claimed that the quantity and quality of facial expressions of congenitally blind persons deteriorate with increasing age. Here, we compared facial expressions of born blind and sighted individuals using adults predominantly. Facial expressions were documented in an individual interview inducing such emotions as think-concentrate, sadness, anger, disgust, joy, and surprise.
Common characteristics found amongst studied individuals were: similar repertoires* of movements over the entire interview, high-frequency and high-repertoire proportion of facial movements in concentration, sadness, and anger relative to those in disgust, joy, and surprise, similar distributions of a cumulative repertoire proportion of facial movements, and also common behavioral profiles of frequencies of facial movements in the emotional states discussed. Similar displays of eyebrow movements were found as well in concentration, sadness, and anger.

22445274;wos455;Khlebnikov and Sukhovo-Kobylin on the problem of the textology of russian cosmism;Penskaya EN;Journal Article;Khlebnikov and Sukhovo-Kobylin are artists that can be described using Khlebnikov's definition: a 'self-valuable word'. Utopia as a dramatic penetration of the philosophy of creativity into practical life is the main point that distinguishes Khlebnikov and Sukhovo-Kobylin from pre-symbolists, symbolists, modernists and brings them close to each other. Yuri Tynyanov called Khlebnikov the 'Lobachevsky of words'. S.T. Aksakov perceived Sukhovo-Kobylin as a 'mad mathematician'. Perhaps, Vyacheslav Ivanov was first to intuitively put Khlebnikov and Sukhovo-Kobylin on a par with each other. In his dialogue on the complexity of consciousness and connection with cosmos, he speaks about the classification of types of civilization according to the level of technological development. Ivanov considers Sukhovo-Kobylin to be the forerunner of modem reflections on this subject. Sukhovo-Kobylin's cosmism fits into a corpus of texts, the framework of which is limited by three components: the philosophy of Vsemir, Hegel's translations and the theatrical cycle. All of Khlebnikov's gestures, enshrined in the word, have the energy of cosmos, among which The Boards o f Fate is the most representative, cosmos-forming. It is a book that combines chronological tables of historical events, dates of the lives of great people, algebraic formulas with the equations of writers' lives ('The Equation of Gogol's Life'), poems, philosophical arguments, thoughts and notes from notebooks. It also has numerous draft notebooks, albums and separate drafts with notes of calculations. Sukhovo- Kobylin and Khlebnikov are connected by a constant desire to structure and streamline the universe. This general tendency is differently realized in different periods, it has different biographical and creative motivations. Khlebnikov's and Sukhovo- Kobylin's search for orderliness and a single logic often revolved around historical events, names and dates. Particular sensitivity to number series also united them. Each followed his own way of thinking in search of algorithms with rigorous mathematical proof. The world of numbers appears in both Sukhovo-Kobylin's and Khlebnikov's works as belonging to the theater, acting, masquerade. Khlebnikov and Sukhovo- Kobylin, in a sense, are directors of a universal performance and intermediaries and translators in creating a special 'language of cosmos'. Both create a 'speech transfer', transcribing everyday speech in mathematical signs and symbols. Numbers and words in this system of 'Russian cosmism' reliably and clearly convey the 'multi-extended unity of the world'.

22445187;wos456;Debunking two myths against vocal origins of language Language is iconic and multimodal to the core;Perlman M;Journal Article;"Conference:
13th International Cognitive Linguistics Conference
Gesture-first theories of language origins often raise two unsubstantiated arguments against vocal origins. First, they argue that great ape vocal behavior is highly constrained, limited to a fixed, species-typical repertoire of reflexive calls. Second, they argue that vocalizations lack any significant potential to ground meaning through iconicity, or resemblance between form and meaning. This paper reviews the considerable evidence that debunks these two 'myths'. Accumulating evidence shows that the great apes exercise voluntary control over their vocal behavior, including their breathing apparatus, larynx, and supralaryngeal articulators. They are also able to learn new vocal behaviors, and even show some rudimentary ability for vocal imitation. In addition, an abundance of research demonstrates that the vocal modality affords rich potential for iconicity. People can understand iconicity in sound symbolism, and they can produce iconic vocalizations to communicate a diverse range of meanings. Thus, two of the primary arguments against vocal origins theories are not tenable. As an alternative, the paper concludes that the origins of language - going as far back as our last common ancestor with great apes - are rooted in iconicity in both gesture and vocalization.";Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Can people create novel vocalizations that are comprehensible to naive listeners without prior convention? We launched a contest in which participants submitted non-linguistic vocalizations for 30 meanings spanning actions, humans, animals, inanimate objects, properties, quantifiers and demonstratives. The winner was determined by the ability of naive listeners to infer the meanings of the vocalizations. We report a series of experiments and analyses that evaluated the vocalizations for: (1) comprehensibility to naive listeners; (2) the degree to which they were iconic; (3) agreement between producers and listeners in iconicity; and (4) whether iconicity helps listeners learn the vocalizations as category labels. The results show contestants were able to create successful iconic vocalizations for most of the meanings, which were largely comprehensible to naive listeners, and easier to learn as category labels. These findings demonstrate how iconic vocalizations can enable interlocutors to establish understanding in the absence of conventions. They suggest that, prior to the advent of full-blown spoken languages, people could have used iconic vocalizations to ground a spoken vocabulary with considerable semantic breadth.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

22445448;wos460;Expressive Copying Behavior for Social Agents: A Perceptual Analysis;"Castellano G; Mancini M; Peters C; McOwan P W";Journal Article;Successful human interaction commonly involves prototypical exchanges where interactors are engaged, synchronized, and harmonious in their behaviors. The copying of aspects of the other's behavior, at different levels, seems central to establishing and maintaining such empathic connections. Yet, many questions remain unanswered, particularly how it is possible to reflect the same affective content back to the other when the actual motion itself is not exactly the same as theirs. This paper presents a perceptual study in which emotional gestures conducted by an actor were mapped onto synthesized versions generated by an embodied virtual agent. Copying is at the expressive level, where qualities such as the fluidity or expansiveness of gestures are considered, rather than exact low-level motion matching. Participants were later asked to rate the emotional content of video recordings of both the original and the synthesized gestures. A statistical analysis shows that, in most cases, participants associated the emotional content of the agent's gestures with that intended to be expressed by the original actor. The results suggest that a combination of the type of movement performed and its quality is important for successfully communicating emotions.;Included;Excluded;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Stretches of discourse from a pivotal scene in the original English-language production are analysed, and it is revealed that the filmmaker's development of the main characters is as much reliant on language choice, style shifts and the pragmatics of African American English as it is on visual cinematic devices like facial and gestural expression, costume and on-screen action. The article then addresses the same discourse, but this time from Fale comigo, the Brazilian Portuguese subtitled and dubbed versions of the film. By carrying out a careful analysis of these stretches of stylised discourse, the 'translated' characters can be compared to the original characters. The subtitled speech is argued to be bland and ineffectual, with much of the stylised African American English representations and meaningful verbal jockeying between the characters lost in translation. On the other hand, the dubbed speech is rich in its own regard and brings forth characters who, although speaking Brazilian Portuguese varieties, demonstrate similar linguistic profiles to those in the original film. These observations are partially corroborated by means of an informal audience response exercise where a small number of Brazilians watched one or the other version and later came together to comment on the characters. The question of character equivalence in discourse-rich films like Talk to me suggests that successful screen translators take their target audience under consideration and view the challenge of rendering cinematic discourse into another language from both a linguistic and sociocultural perspective.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Recent reports have documented similar neuroanatomical asymmetries and their relationship to hand preference in some nonhuman primate species, including chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys. We investigated whether capuchins displayed significant hand preferences for a tool-use task and whether such preferences were associated with motor-processing regions of the brain. Handedness data on a dipping tool-use task and high-resolution 3T MRI scans were collected from 15 monkeys. Capuchins displayed a significant group-level left-hand preference for this type of tool use, and handedness was associated with asymmetry of the primary motor cortex. Left-hand preferent individuals displayed a deeper central sulcus in the right hemisphere. Our results suggest that capuchins show an underlying right-hemisphere bias for skilled movement. Am. J.

23080878;wos463;Reconsidering phonaesthemes: Submorphemic invariance in English 'sn- words';Philps D;Journal Article;I reconsider the English phonaestheme sn- in order to provide a principled explanation for the dyadic sn-/nasality relation, noted by many scholars, in words such as sneeze, sniff and snore. After discussing the structural aspects of this relation and the morphological status of phonaesthemes, I focus on the issue of meaning in a psychomechanical perspective, before analysing core invariance in phonosemantic 'sn-/n- doublets' such as sniff/niff. I then examine the notion of nasality within the framework of embodied semantics, and explore the cognitive status of phonaesthemes within a topological paradigm. I adduce a possible diachronic evolution between Old and Modern English (word-initial /xn/ > /n/ -> /sn/) to account for the fact that one particular subset of 'sn- words' has meanings related to biting, and investigate the issue of arbitrariness with respect to sn- and other phonaesthemes. Finally, in order to address the possible origins of the sn-/nasality relation within the phylogenetic perspective provided by semiogenesis, I adopt the gestural approach advocated by articulatory phonology and conclude, within a theory of the emergence and evolution of the linguistic sign (STEELS), that the naturally nasal quality of n may originally have endowed it with a metonymically based, self-referential capacity.

Here, we shed new light on this topic by providing the first systematic, quantitative comparison of gestural development in two different chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus and Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) subspecies and communities living in their natural environments. We conclude that the three most predominant perspectives on gestural acquisition-Phylogenetic Ritualization, Social Transmission via Imitation, and Ontogenetic Ritualization-do not satisfactorily explain our current findings on gestural interactions in chimpanzees in the wild. In contrast, we argue that the role of interactional experience and social exposure on gestural acquisition and communicative development has been strongly underestimated. We introduce the revised Social Negotiation Hypothesis and conclude with a brief set of empirical desiderata for instigating more research into this intriguing research domain.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

An adjacency pair is a sequential structure produced by both speakers, consisting of two parts, with the second part being contingent upon and normatively obliged to the first part, such as greeting-greeting exchanges. The present paper investigates such ordered serial utterances in chimpanzee greeting interactions. Results show that reciprocal and structured communicative 'discourse' is relatable to the communicative modality that is chosen for greetings as well as to the social bonding between the greeting interactants.

We carried out three experimental studies testing if children generalized the one-to-one correspondence in conventional number gestures to unconventional gestures. In Study 1, children between two and five years of age showed little sensitivity to iconicity, tending to be more accurate with conventional than unconventional gestures. In Study 2, we randomly assigned children to count on their fingers or to count only with words. Children with finger-counting experience did not improve in interpreting unconventional number gestures. In Study 3, we compared age-matched samples of children in school (in France) and children in daycare On Canada).

A total of 80 French-speaking 2- and 3-year-olds were confronted with impossible (1 + 1 = 1 or 1 + 1 = 3) and possible (1 + 1 = 2) addition problems that triggered the bias. The problems were either presented to the children by the experimenter (onlooker mode) or realized by themselves (actor mode). The 2-year-olds performed better in the actor mode than in the onlooker mode. A subtraction control with no language ambiguity (2-1 = 2 or 1) was conducted with 80 other children; both modes elicited comparable performances regardless of age.

Design/methodology/approach - The study primarily aims to assess user performance at the very beginning of the learning process. However, a partial longitudinal evaluation is also provided. Two kinds of experiments have been implemented involving 14 testers.
Findings - Results show that while the virtual keyboard is faster, EyeWrite and Eye-S are also appreciated and can be viable alternatives (after a proper training period).
Practical implications - Writing methods based on eye gestures deserve special attention, as they require less screen space and need limited tracking precision. This study highlights the fact that gesture-based techniques imply a greater initial effort, and require proper training not only to gain knowledge of eye interaction per se, but also for learning the gesture alphabet. The author thinks that the investigation can drive the designers of gaze-controlled writing techniques based on gestures to put more consideration on the intuitiveness of gestures themselves, as they may greatly influence user performance in the first stages of the learning process.
Originality/value - This is the first study comparing EyeWrite and Eye-S.

In Merleau-Ponty, the genetic question is linked to the notion of the body and the pre-categorial expressiveness of gestures, in which silence describes a dimension that is opaque and thematically unattainable, but original and decisive for the phenomenological viewpoint. Derrida, in contrast, is a radical critic of the philosophical use of such origin, and therefore also of the projection to a primitive silence sought by Merleau-Ponty. However, the notion of silence in Merleau-Ponty does not fully meet fully the role assigned to it by Derrida, silence being always for Merleau- Ponty a diachronic and differential space. This article aims to show the points in common and the differences between Merleau- Ponty and Derrida on the issue of language in general.

22444958;wos477;Multimodal Signal Testing Reveals Gestural Tapping Behavior in Spotted Reed Frogs;"Starnberger I; Maier PM; Hodl W; Preininger D";Journal Article;In the majority of anuran species, acoustic signals are the dominant mode of inter-and intrasexual communication. Male calls are always accompanied by the movement of a more or less conspicuous vocal sac-a potential visual cue. Reed frogs possess a striking vocal sac with a colorful patch of gland tissue clearly visible once the vocal sac is inflated during acoustic signaling. To investigate the visual signal function of vocal sac and gular gland, we presented male Spotted Reed Frogs (Hyperolius puncticulatus) with unimodal and multimodal signal playbacks of conspecific rivals in their natural habitat and recorded their behavioral responses. We found no difference in receiver response to unimodal advertisement call stimuli and to multimodal stimulus presentations of calls combined with visual signals of an artificial vocal sac with or without a gular patch, moving synchronously or asynchronously with the call playback. The inflations of a vocal sac with a colorful gular patch did not alter receiver response and neither increase nor decrease signal salience during male-male communication. Interestingly, males frequently displayed a novel hind and front foot-tapping behavior in response to all playbacks. Comparison of male responses to advertisement and aggressive call playbacks showed that Spotted Reed Frogs approached the sound source less during aggressive call presentations. Tapping behavior was not influenced by either call playback. We suggest that the gestural tapping behavior might act as vibrational signal and discuss its potential signal function in male contests and courtship for females.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445296;wos478;The origins of gestures and language: history, current advances and proposed theories;"Prieur J; Barbu S; Blois-Heulin C; Lemasson A";Journal Article;Investigating in depth the mechanisms underlying human and non-human primate intentional communication systems (involving gestures, vocalisations, facial expressions and eye behaviours) can shed light on the evolutionary roots of language. Reports on non-human primates, particularly great apes, suggest that gestural communication would have been a crucial prerequisite for the emergence of language, mainly based on the evidence of large communication repertoires and their associated multifaceted nature of intentionality that are key properties of language. Such research fuels important debates on the origins of gestures and language. We review here three non-mutually exclusive processes that can explain mainly great apes' gestural acquisition and development: phylogenetic ritualisation, ontogenetic ritualisation, and learning via social negotiation. We hypothesise the following scenario for the evolutionary origins of gestures: gestures would have appeared gradually through evolution via signal ritualisation following the principle of derived activities, with the key involvement of emotional expression and processing. The increasing level of complexity of socioecological lifestyles and associated daily manipulative activities might then have enabled the acquisition and development of different interactional strategies throughout the life cycle. Many studies support a multimodal origin of language. However, we stress that the origins of language are not only multimodal, but more broadly multicausal. We propose a multicausal theory of language origins which better explains current findings. It postulates that primates' communicative signalling is a complex trait continually shaped by a cost-benefit trade-off of signal production and processing of interactants in relation to four closely interlinked categories of evolutionary and life cycle factors: species, individual and context-related characteristics as well as behaviour and its characteristics. We conclude by suggesting directions for future research to improve our understanding of the evolutionary roots of gestures and language.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444996;wos479;From actions to events Communicating through language and gesture;Pustejovsky J;Journal Article;In this paper, I argue that an important component of the language-ready brain is the ability to recognize and conceptualize events. By 'event', I mean any situation or activity in the world or our mental life, that we find salient enough to individuate as a thought or word. While this may sound either trivial or non-unique to humans, I hope to show that abstracting away events and their participants from the embodied flow of experience is a characteristic unique to humans. This ability is enabled, I will argue, by two critical competencies that act as scaffolds for language-ready thought in the prehuman brain. The first, as argued by Arbib (2006, 2012, 2016) and others, is a sophisticated system of gesture production and understanding in prehumans, which provided a template for schema-like sequencing and slot-filling of information units. The second involves the integration of multiple modalities of expression in the communicative act, in particular, the alignment of co-gestural speech and co-speech gesture. With such computational facilities, action-based gestures can be abstracted away from their associated objects and become full event representations. This view supports the MSH argument for the emergence of more complex linguistic expressions from initially holophrastic units. In particular, actions can be thought of as protoverbs, which through this process are abstracted to full event descriptions, i.e., verbs.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To test this claim, we presented 9-14 month-old infants with videos of speakers using synchronous dynamic vs. static gestures (Study 1) or synchronous dynamic vs. asynchronous dynamic gestures (Study 2) while introducing a novel object. Eye tracking allowed us to measure where infants looked over time during the word-object pairings and during a test for word learning. We hypothesized that dynamic gestures would draw infants' attention from the mouth to the object, that infants would attend more to the object at the time the word was spoken when the gesture was dynamic and synchronous with speech, and that synchrony of gesture and speech would result in better word learning. These three hypotheses were supported.";Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For example, power grip responses are performed relatively fast with the open-back vowel [a], whereas precision grip responses are performed relatively fast with the close-front vowel [i]. In the present study, the participants were presented with a picture of a hand shaped to the precision or power grip. They were required to pronounce speech sounds according to the front/above perspective of the hand. The results showed that not only the grip performance is affected by simultaneously pronouncing the speech sound but also the production of speech sound can be affected by viewing an image of a grip. The precision grip stimulus triggered relatively rapid production of the front-close vowel [i]. In contrast, the effect related to the power grip stimulus was mostly linked to the vertical dimension of the pronounced vowel since this stimulus triggered relatively rapid production of the back-open vowel [a] and back-mid-open vowel [o] while production of the back-close vowel [u] was not influenced by it. The fact that production of the dorsal consonant [k] or coronal consonant [t] were not influenced by these stimuli suggests that the effect was not associated with a relative front-back tongue shape of the articulation in the absence of changes in any vertical articulatory components. These findings provide evidence for an intimate interaction between certain articulatory gestures and grip types, suggesting that an overlapping visuomotor network operates for planning articulatory gestures and grasp actions.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

His oeuvre is unremittingly autobiographical, narrating desultory journeys into a vulnerable yet stoic, companionless life. The poem that the paper analyses is one of his most well known. Two streaks of narrative run parallel in the poem: the protagonist's act of suicide without any apparent reason and the ceaseless brutality of nature as a way of life. The poem has occasioned a large body of critical literature. As against the prevalent interpretation of the poem, which privileges self-consciousness and a dialectical scheme of interpretation, we set off a Foucauldian, archeo-genealogical reading. In our reading, the poem is a theater of many voices constituting a matrix of language, which, strictly speaking, is a non-language articulations that perfectly fold back against one another to implicate in a tautological bind the originary meaninglessness of living and of life's constitutive cruelty. Here negation is uncontainable and illimitable, always spilling over, always open to possibilities of being otherwise, its trail running in negating almost inevitably negation itself and thus gesturing an aleatory renewal of a space for the political.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

One challenge in comparing human and nonhuman primate handedness involves the procedures used to characterize individual handedness. Studies of human handedness use consistency in hand use within and between tasks as a basis for hand preference classification. In contrast, studies of handedness in nonhuman primates use statistical criteria for classifying handedness. In this study, we examined within-and between-task consistency in hand use as a means of characterizing individual handedness in a sample of 300 captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Chimpanzees showed population-level right-handedness for both within-and between-tasks consistency, though the proportion of right-handed chimpanzees was lower than what has typically been reported for humans. We further found that there were small, but significant, associations in hand use between measures. There were no significant sex or colony effects on the distribution of handedness.

22445452;wos488;An articulatory-perceptual account of vocalization and elision of dark [l] in the Romance languages;Recasens D;Journal Article;This investigation seeks to understand the factors causing vocalization and elision of dark /1/ in the Romance languages. Contrary to articulatory and perceptual-based arguments in the literature it is claimed that preconsonantal vocalization conveys the phonemic categorization of the /w/-like formant transitions generated by the tongue dorsum retraction gesture (in a similar fashion to other processes such as /Vjn/ > /Vjn/). The evolution /Vw1C/ > /VwC/ may be explained using articulatory and perceptual arguments. A dissimilatory perceptual mechanism is required in order to account for a much higher frequency of vocalizations before dentals and alveolars than before labials and velars in the Romance languages. Through this process listeners assign the gravity property of dark /1/ to a following grave labial or velar consonant but not so to a following acute dental or alveolar consonant in spite of the alveolar lateral being equally dark (i.e., grave) in the three consonantal environments. Other articulatory facts appear to play a role in the vocalization of final /1/ (i.e., the occurrence of closure after voicing has ceased) and of geminate /11/ (i.e., its being darker than non-geminate /1/). The elision of dark /1/ may occur preconsonantally and word finally either after vocalization has applied or not.

22445073;wos489;Velar and dental stop consonant softening in Romance;Recasens D;Journal Article;"Experimental and descriptive evidence from the Romance languages suggests that velar and dental stop consonant softening, i.e., the process by which stops of these places of articulation turn mostly into palatoalveolar or alveolar affricates or fricatives, has proceeded gradually through intermediate (alveolo) palatal stop realizations. Several arguments are adduced in support of this interpretation: the presence of (alveolo) palatal stops and of (alveolo) palatal consonants of other manners of articulation in Romance languages and dialects, whether through gestural blending, gestural strengthening or other production strategies; alternations between (alveolo) palatal stops and affricates in several dialectal areas; variability in closure location for (alveolo) palatal stops in general, which accounts for their confusion with dental or velar stops; experimental evidence from speech production and perception studies. Moreover, there appears to be a plausible relationship between (alveolo) palatal stop realizations differing in closure fronting, and differences in fronting in the affricate and fricative outcomes of original Latin dental and velar stops. Historically, those differences depend mainly on place of articulation and voicing for the original stop as well as on the contextual and position conditions in which the stop occurred. The present investigation reveals that fine articulatory detail needs to be taken into consideration in the formulation of phonetic explanations of sound change.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Conceptually, gesture and joint attention abilities may reflect a similar underlying social-communicative skill. However, these abilities are often studied separately. Despite the fact that gesture is often used in episodes of joint attention, little is known about the degree to which measures of gesture use and joint attention ability are associated with one another or how they similarly, or differentially, predict children's language abilities. Participants in this study were 53 infants. At 12 months, multiple measures of infants' gesture use were gleaned from a free-play interaction with a parent. Infants' responding to and initiating joint attention were measured via the Early Social-Communicative Scales (Mundy et al., 2003). Infants' expressive and receptive language was measured at 24 months with the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (Mullen, 1995). A factor analysis including gesture and joint attention measures indicated that at 12 months, joint attention, particularly responding to joint attention, reflects a similar underlying construct with infant gesture use, yet they uniquely predict later language ability.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444947;wos491;The cooperative nature of communicative acts;Reich W;Journal Article;Communicative interaction is a form of social interaction where individuals use overtly intentional acts, such as utterances, gestures or controlled facial expressions. The available evidence from the fields of animal communication and paleoanthropology suggests (1) that humans are the only primates that are naturally able and motivated to engage in communicative interaction, and (2) that this ability evolved for the purpose of permitting more complex forms of social cooperation in early Homo. I argue that these considerations should prompt us to rethink the basic functional anatomy of communicative acts. The hypothesis offered here is that most communicative acts can be reconceptualized as proposals or requests for the addressee to carry out a cooperative response. This hypothesis turns out to work effectively for many imperative as well as interrogative acts. I show that it also extends to a large class of declarative acts, with the exception of a well-defined residual category. The suggested reconceptualization of communicative acts, I argue, is not only compatible with evolutionary theory. It is also more 'social' than Austin's and Searle's original conception of speech acts because it explains how the agency of addressees is implied by the performance of many communicative acts.

22445205;wos492;De-identification for privacy protection in multimedia content: A survey;"Ribaric S; Ariyaeeinia A; Pavesic N; ";Journal Article;Privacy is one of the most important social and political issues in our information society, characterized by a growing range of enabling and supporting technologies and services. Amongst these are communications, multimedia, biometrics, big data, cloud computing, data mining, internet, social networks, and audio video surveillance. Each of these can potentially provide the means for privacy intrusion. De identification is one of the main approaches to privacy protection in multimedia contents (text, still images, audio and video sequences and their combinations). It is a process for concealing or removing personal identifiers, or replacing them by surrogate personal identifiers in personal information in order to prevent the disclosure and use of data for purposes unrelated to the purpose for which the information was originally obtained. Based on the proposed taxonomy inspired by the Safe Harbour approach, the personal identifiers, i.e., the personal identifiable information, are classified as non-biometric, physiological and behavioural biometric, and soft biometric identifiers. In order to protect the privacy of an individual, all of the above identifiers will have to be de-identified in multimedia content. This paper presents a review of the concepts of privacy and the linkage among privacy, privacy protection, and the methods and technologies designed specifically for privacy protection in multimedia contents. The study provides an overview of de-identification approaches for non-biometric identifiers (text, hairstyle, dressing style, license plates), as well as for the physiological (face, fingerprint, iris, ear), behavioural (voice, gait, gesture) and soft-biometric (body silhouette, gender, age, race, tattoo) identifiers in multimedia documents.

This study relies on an alternative model of communication, semiotic alignment, which sees communicative interaction as a dialogical process of joint semiosis resulting in the alignment of the interactants' own-worlds (Umwelten). We conducted an experiment where dyads composed of an elephant instruction-giver and a human instruction-receiver needed to engage in dynamic and interactive communication in order to solve a cooperative object-choice task. Our results showed that dyads were able to solve the task well above chance levels. Moreover, cross-recurrence analysis revealed that interactants were synchronizing referential indexical gestures (pointing with a limb) throughout the experiment. However, we were not able to confirm a direct correlation between joint deixis and experimental outcomes, presumably because these outcomes are dependent on other forms of joint semiosis not analysed in this study.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Current research on the evolution of music has mainly focused on its melodic attribute which would have evolved alongside (proto-)language. Instead, we propose an alternative conceptual framework which focuses on the co-evolution of rhythm and dance (R&D) as intertwined aspects of a multimodal phenomenon characterized by the unity of action and perception. Reviewing the current literature from this viewpoint we propose the hypothesis that R&D have co-evolved long before other musical attributes and (proto-)language. Our view is supported by increasing experimental evidence particularly in infants and children: beat is perceived and anticipated already by newborns and rhythm perception depends on body movement. Infants and toddlers spontaneously move to a rhythm irrespective of their cultural background. The impulse to dance may have been prepared by the susceptibility of infants to be soothed by rocking. Conceivable evolutionary functions of R&D include sexual attraction and transmission of mating signals. Social functions include bonding, synchronization of many individuals, appeasement of hostile individuals, and pre- and extra-verbal communication enabling embodied individual and collective memorizing. In many cultures R&D are used for entering trance, a base for shamanism and early religions. Individual benefits of R&D include improvement of body coordination, as well as painkilling, anti-depressive, and anti-boredom effects. Rhythm most likely paved the way for human speech as supported by studies confirming the overlaps between cognitive and neural resources recruited for language and rhythm. In addition, dance encompasses visual and gestural communication. In future studies attention should be paid to which attribute of music is focused on and that the close mutual relation between R&D is taken into account. The possible evolutionary functions of dance deserve more attention.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The results showed that puppies, independent of age, could use all human communicative cues provided; only their success at using the marker cue increased with age. In the second and third experiments we investigated the. exibility of the puppies' understanding by reducing the degree to which they could use local enhancement to solve these problems. Here, subjects could not simply approach the hand of the experimenter and follow its direction to the correct location because cups were placed next to the dog instead of next to the experimenter. Six- week- old puppies readily used all of the human communicative cues provided.

Four of our 11 patients with Joubert syndrome(36.36%) presented a favourable evolution. Their age ranged between 25 months old and 12 years old. The comprehensive language corresponded to their ages in 3 patients. Two patients began to talk at 19 and 20 months respectively. Three children exhibited a normal language and 1 only communicated by gestures at the time of the last clinical study. All the four children walked without help. The mental level was calculated by the Raven scale in 2 cases and they showed a borderline intellectual quotient (IQ). Both patients were self-sufficient in their daily cleanliness and feeding. A patient was able to read, to write and to make mathematical calculi. Conclusions. The Joubert syndrome is a heterogeneous disease from the clinic and genetics points of view, as well as in the evolution.

22445158;wos498;Communicative roots of complex sociality and cognition;"Roberts A I; Roberts S G B";Journal Article;Mammals living in more complex social groups typically have large brains for their body size and many researchers have proposed that the primary driver of the increase in brain size through primate and hominin evolution was the selection pressures associated with sociality. Many mammals, and especially primates, use flexible signals that show a high degree of voluntary control and these signals may play an important role in forming and maintaining social relationships between group members. However, the specific role that cognitive skills play in this complex communication, and how in turn this relates to sociality, is still unclear. The hypothesis for the communicative roots of complex sociality and cognition posits that cognitive demands behind the communication needed to form and maintain bonded social relationships in complex social settings drives the link between brain size and sociality. We review the evidence in support of this hypothesis and why key features of cognitively complex communication such as intentionality and referentiality should be more effective in forming and maintaining bonded relationships as compared with less cognitively complex communication. Exploring the link between cognition, communication and sociality provides insights into how increasing flexibility in communication can facilitate the emergence of social systems characterised by bonded social relationships, such as those found in non-human primates and humans. To move the field forward and carry out both within- and among-species comparisons, we advocate the use of social network analysis, which provides a novel way to describe and compare social structure. Using this approach can lead to a new, systematic way of examining social and communicative complexity across species, something that is lacking in current comparative studies of social structure.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445229;wos499;Convergence and divergence in gesture repertoires as an adaptive mechanism for social bonding in primates;"Roberts A I; Roberts S G B";Journal Article;A key challenge for primates living in large, stable social groups is managing social relationships. Chimpanzee gestures may act as a time-efficient social bonding mechanism, and the presence (homogeneity) and absence (heterogeneity) of overlap in repertoires in particular may play an important role in social bonding. However, how homogeneity and heterogeneity in the gestural repertoire of primates relate to social interaction is poorly understood. We used social network analysis and generalized linear mixed modelling to examine this question in wild chimpanzees. The repertoire size of both homogeneous and heterogeneous visual, tactile and auditory gestures was associated with the duration of time spent in social bonding behaviour, centrality in the social bonding network and demography. The audience size of partners who displayed similar or different characteristics to the signaller (e.g. same or opposite age or sex category) also influenced the use of homogeneous and heterogeneous gestures. Homogeneous and heterogeneous gestures were differentially associated with the presence of emotional reactions in response to the gesture and the presence of a change in the recipient's behaviour. Homogeneity and heterogeneity of gestural communication play a key role in maintaining a differentiated set of strong and weak social relationships in complex, multilevel societies.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, how different types of communication are associated with different types of social bonds is poorly understood. Wild chimpanzees have a large repertoire of gestures, from visual gestures to tactile and auditory gestures. We used social network analysis to examine the association between proximity bonds (time spent in close proximity) and rates of gestural communication in pairs of chimpanzees when the intended recipient was within 10 m of the signaller. Pairs of chimpanzees with strong proximity bonds had higher rates of visual gestures, but lower rates of auditory long-range and tactile gestures. However, individual chimpanzees that had a larger number of proximity bonds had higher rates of auditory and tactile gestures and lower rates of visual gestures. These results suggest that visual gestures may be an efficient way to communicate with a small number of regular interaction partners, but that tactile and auditory gestures may be more effective at communicating with larger numbers of weaker bonds.

Previous research has suggested that there is a 'means-ends' dissociation between gesture type and context, whereby one signal may be used across contexts and several signals used within the same context. Such flexibility in signal production demands contextual comprehension, whereby recipients may perceive the context-free message of a given manual gesture, but also decide how to respond by inferring the signaller's goals from the accompanying context. We conducted naturalistic observations of wild East African chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, manual gestures, focusing on recipient perspective-during communicative interactions. Our results indicate that chimpanzees recognize the context-free meanings of gestures and they are also able to respond flexibly by inferring the meaning from the combination of gesture and context, including relative rank. When analysed at the level of gesture type, some gestures were tightly associated with dominant responses and outcomes. Chimpanzee manual gestures are primarily used for directing a recipient's movement or attention but the motivation underlying these gestural requests is inferred by the recipient from the context.

22445056;wos505;Gestural Communication and Mating Tactics in Wild Chimpanzees;"Roberts A I; Roberts S G B";Journal Article;The extent to which primates can flexibly adjust the production of gestural communication according to the presence and visual attention of the audience provides key insights into the social cognition underpinning gestural communication, such as an understanding of third party relationships. Gestures given in a mating context provide an ideal area for examining this flexibility, as frequently the interests of a male signaller, a female recipient and a rival male bystander conflict. Dominant chimpanzee males seek to monopolize matings, but subordinate males may use gestural communication flexibly to achieve matings despite their low rank. Here we show that the production of mating gestures in wild male East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweunfurthii) was influenced by a conflict of interest with females, which in turn was influenced by the presence and visual attention of rival males. When the conflict of interest was low (the rival male was present and looking away), chimpanzees used visual/tactile gestures over auditory gestures. However, when the conflict of interest was high (the rival male was absent, or was present and looking at the signaller) chimpanzees used auditory gestures over visual/tactile gestures. Further, the production of mating gestures was more common when the number of oestrous and non-oestrus females in the party increased, when the female was visually perceptive and when there was no wind. Females played an active role in mating behaviour, approaching for copulations more often when the number of oestrus females in the party increased and when the rival male was absent, or was present and looking away. Examining how social and ecological factors affect mating tactics in primates may thus contribute to understanding the previously unexplained reproductive success of subordinate male chimpanzees.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445226;wos506;Persistence in gestural communication predicts sociality in wild chimpanzees;"Roberts S G B; Roberts A I";Journal Article;A key challenge for primates is coordinating behaviour with conspecifics in large, complex social groups. Gestures play a key role in this process and chimpanzees show considerable flexibility communicating through single gestures, sequences of gestures interspersed with periods of response waiting (persistence), and rapid sequences where gestures are made in quick succession, too rapid for the response waiting to have occurred. The previous studies examined behavioural reactions to single gestures and sequences, but whether this complexity is associated with more complex sociality at the level of the dyad partner and the group as a whole is not well understood. We used social network analysis to examine how the production of single gestures and sequences of gestures was related to the duration of time spent in proximity and individual differences in proximity in wild East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). Pairs of chimpanzees that spent a longer duration of time in proximity had higher rates of persistence sequences, but not a higher rate of single gestures or rapid sequences. The duration of time spent in proximity was also related to the rate of responding to gestures, and response to gesture by activity change. These results suggest that communicative persistence and the type of response to gestures may play an important role in regulating social interactions in primate societies.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Nonetheless, if studies on western populations are plenty, investigations of traditional populations living at subsistence levels are rare. Yet, understanding the geographical variation of phenotypes of handedness is crucial for testing evolutionary hypotheses. We aimed to provide a preliminary investigation of factors affecting handedness in 25 Aka pygmies from Central African Republic when spontaneously gesturing or manipulating food/tools (N-actions=593).
Materials and methods: We recorded spontaneous behaviors and characterized individuals' hand preference using GLMM with descriptive variables as target position, task complexity (unimanual/bimanual), task nature (food/tool manipulation, gesture), and task physical/cognitive constraints (precision or power for manipulative actions and informative content for gestures).
Results: Individuals were lateralized to the right (93%, N=15) when manipulating food/tools but not when gesturing. Hand preference was affected by target position but not by task complexity. While nonexplicitly informative gestures were more biased to the right compared to explicitly informative ones, no differences were found within food/tool manipulation (power or precision vs. none).
Discussion:Although we do not intend to assume generalizable results due to our reduced sample, our observations provide additional information on handedness in a contemporary traditional society.

Taking the CONTAINER image schema as a case, we discuss the plausibility of image schemas in early childhood. We suggest that children do not interact with objects as if a basic and generic CONTAINER cognitive structure preexisted. Instead, in everyday life, they use 'container' objects to fulfill very different functions. As object function is construed by children's participation in triadic child-adult-object experiences through semiotic mediation, we propose image schemas are not natural or direct, do not exist in early childhood, and are a developmental, pragmatic, and cultural product. As empirical illustration, we analyze a child-mother-objects interaction at home. (C) 2017 S.

22444898;wos511;An Interactive View on the Development of Deictic Pointing in Infancy;"Rohlfing K J; Grimminger A; Luke C";Journal Article;In this review, we will focus on the development of deictic pointing gestures. We propose that they are based on infants' sensitivities to human motion. Since both conventionalized gestures and bodily movements can be interpreted as communicative, of special interest to us is how pointing gestures are employed within early social interactions. We push forward the idea of a conventionalization process taking place when the interaction partners guide infants' participation toward joint goals. On their way to deploy pointing gestures and thus to successfully influence the partner for a specific purpose, infants need also to disengage from their own object perception or manipulation. In addition, infants accompany their gestures increasingly with verbal utterances-this form of communication is multimodal and offers the possibility to combine modalities for the purpose of expressing more complex utterances. The multimodal behavior will be picked up by caregivers and extended into linguistically more complex forms. Because of this emerging relationship to language and its social use, gestural behavior in early infancy is a powerful predictor for later language development.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445332;wos512;Integration of faces and vocalizations in ventral prefrontal cortex: Implications for the evolution of audiovisual speech;Romanski L M;Journal Article;The integration of facial gestures and vocal signals is an essential process in human communication and relies on an interconnected circuit of brain regions, including language regions in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Studies have determined that ventral prefrontal cortical regions in macaques [e.g., the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC)] share similar cytoarchitectonic features as cortical areas in the human IFG, suggesting structural homology. Anterograde and retrograde tracing studies show that macaque VLPFC receives afferents from the superior and inferior temporal gyrus, which provide complex auditory and visual information, respectively. Moreover, physiological studies have shown that single neurons in VLPFC integrate species-specific face and vocal stimuli. Although bimodal responses may be found across a wide region of prefrontal cortex, vocalization responsive cells, which also respond to faces, are mainly found in anterior VLPFC. This suggests that VLPFC may be specialized to process and integrate social communication information, just as the IFG is specialized to process and integrate speech and gestures in the human brain.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445671;wos513;Dog Breed Differences in Visual Communication with Humans;"Konno A; Romero T; Inoue-Murayama M; Saito A; Hasegawa T";Journal Article;Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) have developed a close relationship with humans through the process of domestication. In human-dog interactions, eye contact is a key element of relationship initiation and maintenance. Previous studies have suggested that canine ability to produce human-directed communicative signals is influenced by domestication history, from wolves to dogs, as well as by recent breed selection for particular working purposes. To test the genetic basis for such abilities in purebred dogs, we examined gazing behavior towards humans using two types of behavioral experiments: the 'visual contact task' and the 'unsolvable task'. A total of 125 dogs participated in the study. Based on the genetic relatedness among breeds subjects were classified into five breed groups: Ancient, Herding, Hunting, Retriever-Mastiff and Working). We found that it took longer time for Ancient breeds to make an eye-contact with humans, and that they gazed at humans for shorter periods of time than any other breed group in the unsolvable situation. Our findings suggest that spontaneous gaze behavior towards humans is associated with genetic similarity to wolves rather than with recent selective pressure to create particular working breeds.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23080799;wos514;Pick-and-place application development using voice and visual commands;"van Delden S; Umrysh M Rosario C; Hess G";Journal Article;"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to design an interactive industrial robotic system which can be used to assist a 'layperson' in re-casting a generic pick-and-place application. A user can program a pick-and-place application simply by pointing to objects in the work area and speaking simple and intuitive natural language commands.
Design/methodology/approach - The system was implemented in C# using the EMGU wrapper classes for OpenCV as well as the MS Speech Recognition API. The target language to be recognized was modelled using traditional augmented transition networks which were implemented as XML Grammars. The authors developed an original finger-pointing algorithm using a unique combination of standard morphological and image processing techniques. Recognized voice commands trigger the vision component to capture what a user is pointing at. If the specified action requires robot movement, the required information is sent to the robot control component of the system, which then transmits the commands to the robot controller for execution.
Findings - The voice portion of the system was tested on the factory floor in a 'typical' manufacturing environment, which was right at the maximum allowable average decibel level specified by OSHA. The findings show that a modern/standard MS Speech API voice recognition system can achieve a 100 per cent accuracy of simple commands; although at the noisy levels of 89 decibels on average, every one out of six commands had to be repeated. The vision component was test of 72 test subjects who had no prior knowledge of this work. The system accurately recognized what the test subjects were pointing at 95 per cent of the time within five seconds of hand readjusting.
Research limitations/implications - The vision component suffers from the 'typical' problems: very shiny surfaces can cause problems; very poor contrast between the pointing hand and the background; and occlusions. Currently the system can only handle a limited amount of depth recovery using a spring mounted gripper. A second camera (future work) needs to be incorporated in order to handle large depth variations in the work area.
Practical implications - This system could have a huge impact on how factory floor workers interact with robotic equipment.
Originality/value - The testing of the voice system on a factory floor, although simple, is very important. It proves the viability of this component of the system and debunks arguments that factories are simply too noisy for current voice technology. The unique finger-pointing algorithm developed by the authors is also an important contribution to the field. In particular, the manner in which the pointing vector was constructed. Furthermore, very few papers report results of non-experts using their pointing algorithms.

However, problems arose when the VOT parameter was used to define stops in actual spoken language, to replace aerodynamic and physiological parameters. A representative physiological model from the same time-period that avoided these problems is sketched. In this model, the manner-of-articulation of a stop is determined by the duration, timing, and extent of laryngeal, articulatory, and respiratory gestures. It is concluded that the term voice onset time should be used only as a parameter in speech synthesis, as originally intended, and not for the analysis of actual speech.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Its evolution has coincided with the expansion of organized crime, creating the impression that the icon belongs to a coherent 'narco-culture.' This article contextualizes ritual practices at a single altar in Tepito, a Mexico City neighborhood historically specialized in informal and illegal commerce. Its monthly prayer service, which dates to September 2001, now balances the needs of its congregation with a kind of response to accusations against devotees in the mass media. Ironically, the range of gestures that share Santa Muerte iconography encompasses laments and high-minded indignation over blanket attribution of violent intentions to a population, but also a language for making threats.

This study investigated how patients with severe aphasia communicated in daily living, which verbal and nonverbal communication skills were spared and which were impaired, and whether activity limitations in communication are related to verbal impairments.
Methods. Twenty-seven patients with severe aphasia and 9 with moderate aphasia originating from a sample of 102 aphasic persons followed up in a French regional survey were assessed with a communication test and a communication activity limitation questionnaire 12-18 months after a first stroke.
Results. Patients with severe aphasia suffered severe activity limitations in communication, with performance 3-fold lower than that of patients with moderate aphasia, and 4-fold lower than scores attained by normals. Both aphasia severity and communication disability at follow-up were related to the initial severity of aphasia. Using a phone, credit card and a chequebook, reading and filling in administrative documents, and communication behaviours involved in social life were the most severely impaired. Non-verbal communication performance was not related to aphasia severity.

The sudden hunt movements were typical of every prey-abundant landscape since even earlier geological periods. The analysis of Laetoli footprints made by our evolutionary ancestors more than three millions years ago indicates that in a randomly chosen moment, the landscape was full of animals of different species. The language used in the attack moment has to be agitative, only vowels in clausure between two consonants. During the process of further development, those consonants became more and more similar to delimitators, the borders where intrasemiotic realities translate extrasemiotic environment.

In other words, humans use multiple signaling channels concurrently when communicating with one another. For example, people frequently produce manual gestures while speaking, and the words a person perceives are impacted by visual information. For this study, we hypothesized that similar to the way that humans regularly couple their spoken utterances with gestures and facial expressions, chimpanzees regularly produce vocalizations in conjunction with other communicative signals. To test this hypothesis, data were collected from 101 captive chimpanzees living in mixed-sex social groupings of seven to twelve individuals. A total of 2,869 vocal events were collected. The data indicate that approximately 50% of the vocal events were produced in conjunction with another communicative modality. In addition, approximately 68% were directed to a specific individual, and these directed vocalizations were more likely to include a signal from another communicative modality than were vocalizations that were not directed to a specific individual. These results suggest that, like humans, chimpanzees often pair their vocalizations with signals from other communicative modalities. In addition, chimpanzees appear to use their communicative signals strategically to meet specific socio-communicative ends, providing support for the growing literature that indicates that at least some chimpanzee vocal signaling is intentional.

Previous research has shown that climbing is a particularly demanding task, and does not neatly fit into existing cognitive resource models. Climbing is a task relevant to firefighting and search and rescue, and operators often must also handle communication and navigation tasks in tandem. We present the results of a study where a naturalistic narrative memory task was paired with a climbing traverse. As hypothesized, both climbing and memory performance significantly declined in the dual-compared to each single-task condition. The specific cognitive demands of climbing should be explored further using non-verbal secondary tasks, to determine whether an executive resource bottleneck, verbal resource demand, or something else entirely can better explain the dual-task interference. A more thorough understanding of the mental demand in concurrent operational tasks can be used to tailor the modality and timing or diversion of certain tasks for minimal interference.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445178;wos527;Orangutan pantomime: elaborating the message;"Russon A; Andrews K";Journal Article;We present an exploratory study of forest-living orangutan pantomiming, i.e. gesturing in which they act out their meaning, focusing on its occurrence, communicative functions, and complexities. Studies show that captive great apes may elaborate messages if communication fails, and isolated reports suggest that great apes occasionally pantomime. We predicted forest-living orangutans would pantomime spontaneously to communicate, especially to elaborate after communication failures. Mining existing databases on free-ranging rehabilitant orangutans' behaviour identified 18 salient pantomimes. These pantomimes most often functioned as elaborations of failed requests, but also as deceptions and declaratives. Complexities identified include multimodality, re-enactments of past events and several features of language (productivity, compositionality, systematicity). These findings confirm that free-ranging rehabilitant orangutans pantomime and use pantomime to elaborate on their messages. Further, they use pantomime for multiple functions and create complex pantomimes that can express propositionally structured content. Thus, orangutan pantomime serves as a medium for communication, not a particular function. Mining cases of complex great ape communication originally reported in functional terms may then yield more evidence of pantomime.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445706;wos528;Linguistic Violence in Contemporary Russian Public Discourses;Ryazanova-Clarke L;Journal Article;While discourses of violence and discrimination have been given substantial scholarly attention, the specific discursive forms, in which a society deals with linguistic violence at a public level have been insufficiently questioned. Discussing a case study of the introduction in Russia of the law banning the 'Propaganda of Non-traditional Sexual Relations Among Minors' (2013), the article focuses on cross-discursive flows in which the negotiation of linguistic violence takes place, as various groups of society respond to the initial hegemonic trigger. The article's multimethodological approach combines the views of performativity and subjectivity of linguistic violence with the discourse analytical perspective. Discursive flows of interpretations of violence are mapped across the following fields of action: the hegemonic media, the global field, the hegemonic grassroots supporters, the governing field and the grassroots oppositional field. The article concludes that while discourses of counter-violence are contained within the symbolic field, the hegemonic grassroots supporters resignified the original trigger as permission for physical attacks and murder. In other instances, as they perform the resignification of the violent code, discourses both in the hegemonic and the oppositional fields assume similar strategies and interpretative repertoires including citation, magnification and humour. It seems though that in a society, in which stigmatisation and repression increasingly becomes the norm, linguistic counter-violence while performing the role of a quasi-liberating gesture, fails to achieve a relief of a resolution, instead multiplying violence and aggression.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445219;wos529;Relationship between the Sequencing and Timing of Vocal Motor Elements in Birdsong;"Matheson A M M; Sakata J T";Journal Article;Accurate coordination of the sequencing and timing of motor gestures is important for the performance of complex and evolutionarily relevant behaviors. However, the degree to which motor sequencing and timing are related remains largely unknown. Birdsong is a communicative behavior that consists of discrete vocal motor elements ('syllables') that are sequenced and timed in a precise manner. To reveal the relationship between syllable sequencing and timing, we analyzed how variation in the probability of syllable transitions at branch points, nodes in song with variable sequencing across renditions, correlated with variation in the duration of silent gaps between syllable transitions ('gap durations') for adult Bengalese finch song. We observed a significant negative relationship between transition probability and gap duration: more prevalent transitions were produced with shorter gap durations. We then assessed the degree to which long-term age-dependent changes and acute context-dependent changes to syllable sequencing and timing followed this inverse relationship. Age-but not context-dependent changes to syllable sequencing and timing were inversely related. On average, gap durations at branch points decreased with age, and the magnitude of this decrease was greater for transitions that increased in prevalence than for transitions that decreased in prevalence. In contrast, there was no systematic relationship between acute context-dependent changes to syllable sequencing and timing. Gap durations at branch points decreased when birds produced female-directed courtship song compared to when they produced undirected song, and the magnitude of this decrease was not related to the direction and magnitude of changes to transition probabilities. These analyses suggest that neural mechanisms that regulate syllable sequencing could similarly control syllable timing but also highlight mechanisms that can independently regulate syllable sequencing and timing.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, determining how the linguistic and gestural signals are distinguished, how each is structured, and how they interact still poses a challenge for the construction of a comprehensive model of language. This study attempts to advance our understanding of these issues with evidence from sign language. The study adopts McNeill's criteria for distinguishing gestures from the linguistically organized signal, and provides a brief description of the linguistic organization of sign languages. Focusing on the subcategory of iconic gestures, the paper shows that signers create iconic gestures with the mouth, an articulator that acts symbiotically with the hands to complement the linguistic description of objects and events. A new distinction between the mimetic replica and the iconic symbol accounts for the nature and distribution of iconic mouth gestures and distinguishes them from mimetic uses of the mouth. Symbiotic symbolization by hand and mouth is a salient feature of human language, regardless of whether the primary linguistic modality is oral or manual. Speakers gesture with their hands, and signers gesture with their mouths.;Included;Excluded;Non-spontaneous communication;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444939;wos532;The Body as Evidence for the Nature of Language;Sandler W;Journal Article;Taking its cue from sign languages, this paper proposes that the recruitment and composition of body actions provide evidence for key properties of language and its emergence. Adopting the view that compositionality is the fundamental organizing property of language, we show first that actions of the hands, face, head, and torso in sign languages directly reflect linguistic components, and illuminate certain aspects of compositional organization among them that are relevant for all languages, signed and spoken. Studies of emerging sign languages strengthen the approach by showing that the gradual recruitment of bodily articulators for linguistic functions directly maps the way in which a new language increases in complexity and efficiency over time. While compositional communication is almost exclusively restricted to humans, it is not restricted to language. In the spontaneous, intense emotional displays of athletes, different emotional states are correlated with actions of particular face and body features and feature groupings. These findings indicate a much more ancient communicative compositional capacity, and support a paradigm that includes visible body actions in the quest for core linguistic properties and their origins.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444825;wos533;Security as Completeness A Peircean Semiotic Reading of the Psychology of Attachment;Santarelli M;Journal Article;"Peirce's anti-psychologism hinges on two main assumptions. First, logic and psychology belong to two separate disciplines -respectively, the normative sciences and the experimental sciences. Second, externalism must be understood as a crucial and inescapable epistemological criterion. The introspectionist illusion, according to which individuals have direct and epistemologically flawless access to their own internal states, should be dismissed. As Colapietro (2003) and Calcaterra (2006) observe, Peirce's standpoint is far different from the Kantian classical account of anti-psychologism. This original take on anti-psychologism leaves room for a functional distinction between logic and psychology, emerging from a semiotic and communicative continuity. This means that psychology, unlike logic as a formal doctrine of signs, will be epistemologically appropriate for dealing with internal psychological states, on the condition that this inquiry be focused on the communicative processes through which these internal states are expressed and conveyed.



Such a Peircean account of anti-psychologism forms the epistemological background of this paper. My goal is to show how Peirce's approach to communication and semiosis can be applied in order to discuss a specific psychological theory, in this case, attachment theory. Specifically, I propose employing Giovanni Maddalena's Peircean distinction between complete and incomplete gestures (Maddalena 2015) to account for the distinction between secure, dismissing and preoccupied attachment patterns. To this end, I will be discussing three different measurements of attachment: the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI, George, Kaplan & Main 1985), the Adult Attachment Projection (AAP, George & West 2006), and the Patient Attachment Coding System (PACS, Talia, Miller-Bottome & Daniel 2015).

An efficient approach for faster browsing of large video collections and more efficient content indexing and access is video summarization. Compression of data through extraction of keyframes is a solution to these challenges. A keyframe is a representative frame of the salient features of the video. The output frames must represent the original video in temporal order. The proposed research presents a method of keyframe extraction using the mean of consecutive k frames of video data. A sliding window of size k/2> is employed to select the frame that matches the median entropy value of the sliding window. This is called the Median of Entropy of Mean Frames (MME) method.

Apart from Rabindranath's famous adaptation of the text and tune of two of Burns's songs ('Auld Lang Syne' and 'Ye Banks and Braes O'Bonnie Doon'), he also translated four of Burns's songs for the monthly Bharati between 1878 and '79. He indigenizes Burns's songs and deploys the idiom of contemporary Bengali poetry (using throughout a Sanskritized poetic register) without emphasizing the foreign source. As opposed to this, the five translations of Burns's songs by Dwijendaralal Roy (included in Aryagatha, Part 2, 1893) are more innovative, if not always with a happy result. Dwijendralal's translations attempt to be closer to the source text in terms of the overarching temperament. Besides, they experiment with idioms and dialects. As opposed to these two, Satyendranath Dutta in his translation of 'To a Mouse' and 'A Man's a Man for A' that' (included in Tirthasalil, 1908) follows the meaning of the source text with rigorous loyalty. More importantly, he tries to approximate to the rhythm and stanza pattern of the original with startling results. As part of his vast repertoire of lyrics in translation, Satyendranath's rendition of Burns gestures towards a tacit paradigm of 'world literature' and internationalism. This article attempts a comparative study of these translations of Burns with a view to assessing their underlying aesthetics and cross-cultural negotiations.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A comparison of declarative symbol and gesture use in two children, two bonobos, and a chimpanzee;"Lyn H; Greenfield P M; Savage-Rumbaugh S; Gillespie-Lynch K; Hopkins W D";Journal Article;While numerous publications have shown that apes can learn some aspects of human language, one frequently cited difference between humans and apes is the relative infrequency of declaratives (comments and statements) as opposed to imperatives (requests) in ape symbol use. This paper describes the use of declaratives in three language-competent apes and two children. The apes produced a lower proportion of spontaneous declaratives than did the children. However, both groups used declaratives to name objects, to interact and negotiate, and to make comments about other individuals. Both apes and children also made comments about past and future events. However, showing/offering/giving, attention getting, and comments on possession were declarative types made by the children but rarely by the apes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A recent study on chimpanzee reported the first evidence of significant left-hemispheric dominance when using attention-getting sounds and rightward bias for species-typical vocalizations (Losin, Russell, Freeman, Meguerditchian, Hopkins & Fitch, 2008). The current study sought to extend the findings from Losin et al. (2008) with additional oro-facial assessment in a new colony of chimpanzees. When combining the two populations, the results indicated a consistent leftward bias for attention-getting sounds and a right lateralization for species-typical vocalizations. Collectively, the results suggest that both voluntary-controlled oro-facial and gestural communication might share the same left-hemispheric specialization and might have coevolved into a single integrated system present in a common hominid ancestor.

22444906;wos543;The neural and cognitive correlates of aimed throwing in chimpanzees: a magnetic resonance image and behavioural study on a unique form of social tool use;"Hopkins W D; Russell J L; Schaeffer J A";Journal Article;It has been hypothesized that neurological adaptations associated with evolutionary selection for throwing may have served as a precursor for the emergence of language and speech in early hominins. Although there are reports of individual differences in aimed throwing in wild and captive apes, to date there has not been a single study that has examined the potential neuroanatomical correlates of this very unique tool-use behaviour in non-human primates. In this study, we examined whether differences in the ratio of white (WM) to grey matter (GM) were evident in the homologue to Broca's area as well as the motor-hand area of the precentral gyrus (termed the KNOB) in chimpanzees that reliably throw compared with those that do not. We found that the proportion of WM in Broca's homologue and the KNOB was significantly higher in subjects that reliably throw compared with those that do not. We further found that asymmetries in WM within both brain regions were larger in the hemisphere contralateral to the chimpanzee's preferred throwing hand. We also found that chimpanzees that reliably throw show significantly better communication abilities than chimpanzees that do not. These results suggest that chimpanzees that have learned to throw have developed greater cortical connectivity between primary motor cortex and the Broca's area homologue. It is suggested that during hominin evolution, after the split between the lines leading to chimpanzees and humans, there was intense selection on increased motor skills associated with throwing and that this potentially formed the foundation for left hemisphere specialization associated with language and speech found in modern humans.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Data on handedness for unimanual gestures were collected in a sample of 227 captive chimpanzees. Handedness for these gestures was compared with handedness for three other measures of hand use: tool use, reaching, and coordinated bimanual actions. Chimpanzees were significantly more right-handed for gestures than for all other measures of hand use. Hand use for simple reaching at 3 to 4 years of age predicted hand use for gestures 10 years later. Use of the right hand for gestures was significantly higher when gestures were accompanied by a vocalization than when they were not. The collective results suggest that left-hemisphere specialization for language may have evolved initially from asymmetries in manual gestures in the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans, rather than from hand use associated with other, noncommunicative motor actions, including tool use and coordinated bimanual actions, as has been previously suggested in the literature.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445508;wos545;Bird Song Metronomics': lsochronous Organization of Zebra Finch Song Rhythm;"Norton P; Scharff C";Journal Article;The human capacity for speech and vocal music depends on vocal imitation. Songbirds, in contrast to non-human primates, share this vocal production learning with humans. The process through which birds and humans learn many of their vocalizations as well as the underlying neural system exhibit a number of striking parallels and have been widely researched. In contrast, rhythm, a key feature of language, and music, has received surprisingly little attention in songbirds. Investigating temporal periodicity in bird song has the potential to inform the relationship between neural mechanisms and behavioral output and can also provide insight into the biology and evolution of musicality. Here we present a method to analyze birdsong for an underlying rhythmic regularity. Using the intervals from one note onset to the next as input, we found for each bird an isochronous sequence of time stamps, a 'signal-derived pulse,' or pulses, of which a subset aligned with all note onsets of the bird's song. Fourier analysis corroborated these results. To determine whether this finding was just a byproduct of the duration of notes and intervals typical for zebra finches but not dependent on the individual duration of elements and the sequence in which they are sung, we compared natural songs to models of artificial songs. Note onsets of natural song deviated from the pulses significantly less than those of artificial songs with randomized note and gap durations. Thus, male zebra finch song has the regularity required for a listener to extract a perceived pulse (pulseP), as yet untested. Strikingly, in our study, pulsess that best fit note onsets often also coincided with the transitions between sub-note elements within complex notes, corresponding to neuromuscular gestures. Gesture durations often equaled one or more pulses periods. This suggests that gesture duration constitutes the basic element of the temporal hierarchy of zebra finch song rhythm, an interesting parallel to the hierarchically structured components of regular rhythms in human music.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445739;wos546;Perception, expression, and social function of pain - A human ethological view;Schiefenhovel W;Journal Article;Pain has important biomedical, socioanthropological, semiotic, and other facets. In this contribution pain and the expression of pain are looked at from the perspective of evolutionary biology, utilizing, among others, cross-cultural data from field work in Melanesia.No other being cares for sick and suffering conspecifics in the way humans do. Notwithstanding aggression and neglect, common in all cultures, human societies can be characterized as empathic, comforting, and promoting the health and well-being of their members. One important stimulus triggering this caring response in others is the expression of pain. The nonverbal channel of communication, particularly certain universal - i.e., culture-independent facial expressions, gestures, and body postures, convey much of the message from the pain-stricken person to the group. These behaviors signal the person's physical and psychical pain, sadness, grief, and despair in ways very similar to the signs given by infants and small children: the body loses tonus and sinks or drops to the ground, the gestures are those of helplessness. Pain and grief may be so strong that control is lost not only over the body's posture but also over the mind's awareness. In such cases the afflicted person may carry out actions endangering himself or others. In general, these behavior patterns resemble those of infants in situations of distress and danger, and it is not surprising that the response of the members of the group is basically parental: taking care, assisting and consoling. Perceptive and behavioral patterns which developed in the course of avian and mammalian phylogeny to serve the well-being of the young have proven, as was shown by Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1989), to be powerful building blocks for actions in other spheres of human interaction. Love is one such field, the reactions to a conspecific suffering pain is another.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We further investigate the behavior of the co-opted loci under predicate ellipsis. The individual component of a locative-shifted locus can be bound, and in some cases its locative specification can be disregarded in the elided clause, under conditions that are reminiscent of the behavior of phi-features. In other cases, locative specifications are preserved under ellipsis, possibly even with elided indexical pronouns, whose overt counterparts resist Locative Shift. Some of our main findings can be replicated in LSF, although our data leave many questions open. Finally, we argue that some pointing gestures in English can undergo something like Locative Shift.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The journal transition in which Joyce's work was serialized and whose editor, Eugene Jolas, he knew well served as a clear-inghouse for ideas about how a new universalism might be forged: either through Joyce's Wakese and other avant-garde experiments or through the philosopher C. K. Ogden's Basic English. Fascinated by these theories of universal language and drawn to the anti-imperialist politics underlying them, Joyce, in Ulysses and Finnegans Wake, turns to visual and gestural languages film, hieroglyphics, and illuminated manuscripts in an effort to subvert theories of an 'Aryan' language and to imagine a more inclusive origin for all the world's cultures in Egyptian hieroglyphics. Ideas of linguistic or media 'purity' are allied in Joyce with the danger of Nazi claims for racial purity. His emphasis on the commonality of writing and new media becomes a political gesture: a way of insisting on the unity of all races, cultures, and languages in a mythic past.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper investigates how people convey temporal information when they cannot use any conventional languages they know. In a laboratory experiment, adult participants were asked to convey information about simple events taking place at a given time, in spoken language and in silent gesture (i.e., using only gesture and no speech). It was shown that in spoken language, participants formed utterances according to the rules of their native language (Dutch), but in silent gesture, the temporal information was presented initially, and structurally separately, from the other information in the utterance. The experimental results are consistent with findings from natural systems emerging insituations of communicative stress: unsupervised adult second language learning and homesign. This confirms that presenting temporal information separately and initially (directly mirroring how temporal and propositional information can be represented semantically) is a robust strategy to talk about past and future when only sparse communicative means are available.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A series of recent experiments demonstrates that, when prompted to express meanings through silent gesture, people bypass native language conventions, revealing apparent biases underpinning word order usage, based on the semantic properties of the information to be conveyed. We extend the scope of these studies by focusing, experimentally and computationally, on the interpretation of silent gesture. We show cross-linguistic experimental evidence that people use variability in constituent order as a cue to obtain different interpretations. To illuminate the computational principles that govern interpretation of non-conventional communication, we derive a Bayesian model of interpretation via biased inductive inference and estimate these biases from the experimental data. Our analyses suggest people's interpretations balance the ambiguity that is characteristic of emerging language systems, with ordering preferences that are skewed and asymmetric, but defeasible.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445294;wos551;Multimodal metaphors as cognitive pivots for the construction of cultural otherness in talk;Schroder U;Journal Article;When people experience and talk about cultural alterity, they normally refer to polar scales, such as 'individual/collective orientation patterns' or 'direct/indirect ways of speaking' etc. The project of the research group (Inter-) Cultural Communication in Interaction entitled Intercultural communication in extended contacts: linguistic and (self-) reflexive processes (2012-2016) aimed to reveal how exchange students retrospectively co-construct and frame their experiences abroad on a verbal, vocal, and visual-corporal plane in elicited talk on encountered divergent cultural differences. The empirical data of the study originates from the corpus recorded by our group whose activities were initiated at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) in Brazil in 2012 (http://www.letras.ufmg.br/nucleos/nucoi/). The specific proposal was to reveal the connection between communicative and cognitive processes coming into play in the co-construction of cultural dimensions in interaction, especially by the multimodal use of key metaphors and their underlying image schemas. For the theoretical background, conversation analysis and interactional linguistics with its focus on prosodic cues, as well as recent work on the multimodality of cognitive metaphor with its crucial contribution to gesture studies, serve as a starting point for a more detailed microanalytic approach as a first step of analysis. In a second step, we see how the results point to studies in the field of intercultural pragmatics, as well as to underlying polar cognitive cultural schemas, as discussed in cultural linguistics. Schemas found in the sequences might be associated with cultural styles reflected in embodied communication practices: These are STRENGTH/LOOSENESS, the conceptualization of PEOPLE/CULTURES as OPEN or CLOSED, which refers to the CONTAINER schema, as well as RECTILINEAR/DEVIATING MOTIONS designed in relation to the SOURCE-PATH-GOAL schema.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Through these cues the interactants construct and frame their experiences in creative ways. The empirical data originates from the project Intercultural Communication in Interaction, initiated at the University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) in Brazil in 2012. The data bears out a strong interplay of verbal, vocal, and visual elements which are displayed by the participants while they talk about their experiences of alterity: They employ (a) reported speech primarily for referring to opposing value systems sustained by the expression it's like as a quotative construction; (b) lexico-semantic and syntactic parallelism for constructing and underpinning opposing categories; (c) pitch jumps, pauses, laughter, lengthenings, and glides endowed with strong emotion for expressing bewilderment, astonishment, or consternation; (d) facial expressions and gestural devices for contextualizing their experiences of cultural differences in metonymic ways; and, finally, (e) the situational construction of co-membership and affiliation through head nods and laughter to endorse the teller's perspective.

We hypothesized that certain articulatory gestures would be more associated with the precision grip than with the power grip, and vice versa. In the study, the participants pronounced a syllable and performed simultaneously a precision or power grip that was theorized to be either congruent or incongruent with the syllable. Relatively fast precision grip responses were associated with articulatory gestures in which the tip of the tongue contacted the alveolar ridge ([te]) or the aperture of the vocal tract remained small ([hi]), as well as gestures that required lip protrusion ([pu]). In contrast, relatively fast power grip responses were associated with gestures that were produced by moving the back of the tongue against the velum ([ke]) or in which the aperture of the vocal tract remained large ([h alpha]). In addition to demonstrating that certain articulatory gestures are systematically connected to different grip types, the study may shed some light on discussion concerning sound symbolism and evolution of speech.;Included;Excluded;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445024;wos554;Charles Taylor, Phronesis, and Medicine: Ethics and Interpretation in Illness Narrative;"Schultz DS; Flasher LV";Journal Article;This paper provides a brief overview and critique of the dominant objectivist understanding and use of illness narrative in Enlightenment (scientific) medicine and ethics, as well as several revisionist accounts, which reflect the evolution of this approach. In light of certain limitations and difficulties endemic in the objectivist understanding of illness narrative, an alternative phronesis approach to medical ethics influenced by Charles Taylor's account of the interpretive nature of human agency and language is examined. To this end, the account of interpretive medical responsibility previously described by Schultz and Carnevale as 'clinical phronesis' (based upon Taylor's notion of 'strong' or 'radical evaluation') is reviewed and expanded. The thesis of this paper is that illness narrative has the ability to benefit patients as well as the potential to cause harm or iatrogenic effects. This benefit or harm is contingent upon how the story is told and understood. Consequently, these tales are not simply 'nice stories,' cathartic gestures, or mere supplements to scientific procedures and decision making, as suggested by the objectivist approach. Rather, they open the agent to meanings that provide a context for explanation and evaluation of illness episodes and therapeutic activities. This understanding provides indicators (guides) for right action. Hence, medical responsibility as clinical phronesis involves, first, the patient and provider's coformulation and cointerpretation of what is going on in the patient's illness narrative, and second, the patient and provider's response to interpretation of the facts of illness and what they signify-not simply a response to the brute facts of illness, alone. The appeal to medical responsibility as clinical phronesis thus underscores the importance of getting the patient's story of illness right. It is anticipated that further elaboration concerning the idea of clinical phronesis as interpretive illness narrative will provide a new foundation for medical ethics and decision making.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445775;wos555;Integrating Tinbergen's inquiries: Mimicry and play in humans and other social mammals;"Palagi E; Scopa C";Journal Article;Visual signals convey emotions and intentions between individuals. Darwin underlined that human facial expressions represent a shared heritage between our species and many other social mammals. Social play is a fertile field to examine the role and the potential communicative function of facial expressions. The relaxed open-mouth (or play face) is a context-specific playful expression, which is widespread in human and non-human mammals. Here, we focus on playful communication by applying Tinbergen's four areas of inquiry: proximate causation, ontogeny, function, and evolution. First of all we explore mimicry by focusing on its neural substrates and factors of modulation within playful and non-playful context (proximate causation). Play face is one of the earliest facial expressions to appear and be mimicked in neonates. The motor resonance between infants and their caregivers is essential later in life when individuals begin to engage in increasingly complex social interactions, including play (ontogeny). The success of a playful session can be evaluated by its duration in time. Mirroring facial expressions prolongs the session by favoring individuals to fine-tune their own motor sequences accordingly (function). Finally, through a comparative approach we also demonstrate that the elements constituting play communication and mimicry are sensitive to the quality of interindividual relationships of a species, thus reflecting the nature of its social network and style (evolution). In conclusion, our goal is to integrate Tinbergen's four areas of ethological inquiry to provide a broader framework regarding the importance of communication and mimicry in the play domain of humans and other social mammals.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This research has often focused on similarities and differences with the linguistic code, but more recently there has been an increased focus on the social-cognitive foundations of linguistic communication. However, exactly what these comparisons tell us is not clear because the theoretical concepts used in the animal communication literature are different from those used in the corresponding literature on human communication, specifically those used in linguistic pragmatics. In this article, I bridge the gap between these two areas and in doing so specify exactly what great ape communication tells us about the origins of human communication and language. I conclude that great ape communication probably does not share the same social-cognitive foundations as linguistic communication but that it probably does involve the use of metacognitive abilities that, once they evolved to a more sophisticated degree, were exapted for use in what is an evolutionarily novel form of communication: human ostensive communication. This in turn laid the foundations for the emergence of linguistic communication. More generally, I highlight the often-neglected importance of pragmatics for the study of language origins.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445059;wos558;The evolution of communication Humans may be exceptional;Scott-Phillips T C;Journal Article;Communication is a fundamentally interactive phenomenon. Evolutionary biology recognises this fact in its definition of communication, in which signals are those actions that cause reactions, and where both action and reaction are designed for that reason. Where only one or the other is designed then the behaviours are classed as either cues or coercion. Since mutually dependent behaviours are unlikely to emerge simultaneously, the symmetry inherent in these definitions gives rise to a prediction that communication will only emerge if cues or coercive behaviours do so first. They will then be co-opted for communication. A range of case studies, from animal signalling, evolutionary robotics, comparative psychology, and evolutionary linguistics are used to test this prediction. The first three are found to be supportive. However in the Embodied Communication Game, a recent experimental approach to the emergence of communication between adult humans, communication emerges even when cues or coerced behaviours are not possible. This suggests that humans are exceptional in this regard. It is argued that the reason for this is the degree to which we are able and compelled to read and interpret the behaviour of others in intentional terms.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We argue that existing models of learning from cooperative informants have fundamental limitations that prevent them from explaining how cooperation benefits learning. First, existing models are shown to be computationally intractable, suggesting that they cannot apply to realistic learning problems. Second, existing models assume a priori agreement about which concepts are favored in learning, which leads to a conundrum: Learning fails without precise agreement on bias yet there is no single rational choice. We introduce cooperative inference, a novel framework for cooperation in concept learning, which resolves these limitations. Cooperative inference generalizes the notion of cooperation used in previous models from omission of labeled objects to the omission values of features, labels for objects, and labels for collections of objects. The result is an approach that is computationally tractable, does not require a priori agreement about biases, applies to both Boolean and first-order concepts, and begins to approximate the richness of real-world concept learning problems. We conclude by discussing relations to and implications for existing theories of cognition, cognitive development, and cultural evolution.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The principal aims of this study are to assess the concurrent validity and test-retest reliability of the vocabulary section of this adaptation.
Method: Validation for productive vocabulary (Study 1) was achieved by correlating CDI-Down scores on expressive vocabulary and measures on the basis of spontaneous speech samples (n = 29). Validation for receptive vocabulary (Study 2) was achieved by correlating CDI-Down scores on receptive vocabulary and measures derived from language items of the Brunet-Lezine Scale (Josse, 1997; n = 70). Reliability (Study 3) was measured with a subset of parents who completed the same inventory 4 months after the original sampling (n = 26).
Results: CDI-Down expressive and receptive vocabulary scores showed a significant positive relationship with their comparison measures, thereby demonstrating convergent validity. A significant positive relationship was also found between test-retest measures for productive and receptive vocabularies, thus supporting the reliability of the adaptation.

22445471;wos561;Hybrid evolutionary neuro-fuzzy approach based on mutual adaptation for human gesture recognition;"Obo T; Loo C K; Seera M; Kubota N";Journal Article;One of the most important techniques in human-robot communication is gesture recognition. If robots can read intentions from human gestures, the communication process will be smoother and more natural. Processing for gesture recognition typically consists of two parts: feature extraction and gesture classification. In most works, these are independently designed and evaluated by their own criteria. This paper proposes a hybrid approach based on mutual adaptation for human gesture recognition. We use a neuro-fuzzy system (NFS) for the classification of human gesture and apply an evolution strategy for parameter tuning and pruning of membership functions. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of mutual adaptation in terms of the generalization. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

At the same time, an identity is also produced for us socially, which never matches our own self-presentation. Thus social relations are informed by a dynamic of chance and instability and conducted through a process of interpretation and misinterpretation which, dependent as it is on communication, may actually enhance the prospect of social communion. While this model of identity is particularly fitted to postmodern, multicultural society, its origins in Epicureanism and its literary affinity with comedy suggest that Smith's notion of identity owes more to the comedic inclination of novels than to any political imperatives.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I show how involuntary gestures refract and register the impact of the social nervous system on the individual and become the media that, in turn, enable the reading of that nervous system. The concept of the 'nervous system' originated with Michael Taussig as the sensorial somatic registration of both everyday life and the effects of the social structure.

Given that iconicity seems easier and less abstract than making arbitrary connections between sound and meaning, iconicity and gesture have often been invoked in the origin of language alongside the urge to convey meaning. To get a fresh perspective, we critically distinguish the origin of a system capable of evolution from the subsequent evolution that system becomes capable of. Human language arose on a substrate of a system already capable of Darwinian evolution; the genetically supported uniquely human ability to learn a language reflects a key contact point between Darwinian evolution and language. Though implemented in brains generated by DNA symbols coding for protein meaning, the second higher-level symbol-using system of language now operates in a world mostly decoupled from Darwinian evolutionary constraints. Examination of Darwinian evolution of vocal learning in other animals suggests that the initial fixation of a key prerequisite to language into the human genome may actually have required initially side-stepping not only iconicity, but the urge to mean itself. If sign languages came later, they would not have faced this constraint.";Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

8th IFIP International Conference on Engineering for Human-Computer Interaction
In recent years because of the advances in computer vision research, free hand gestures have been explored as means of human-computer interaction (HCI). Together with improved speech processing technology it is an important step toward natural multimodal HCI. However, inclusion of non-predefined continuous gestures into a multimodal framework is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a structured approach for studying patterns of multimodal language in the context of a 2D-display control. We consider systematic analysis of gestures from observable kinematical primitives to their semantics as pertinent to a linguistic structure. Proposed semantic classification of co-verbal gestures distinguishes six categories based on their spatio-temporal deixis. We discuss evolution of a computational framework for gesture and speech integration which was used to develop an interactive testbed (iMAP). The testbed enabled elicitation of adequate, non-sequential, multimodal patterns in a narrative mode of HCI. Conducted user studies illustrate significance of accounting for the temporal alignment of gesture and speech parts in semantic mapping. Furthermore, co-occurrence analysis of gesture/speech production suggests syntactic organization of gestures at the lexical level.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The major focus of this essay is on infant social relationships that develop on the ground of our original corporeal-kinetic apprenticeship. It shows how joint attention, imitation, and turn-taking - all richly examined areas in infant social development - are the foundation of apprenticeship learning in later adult life. The relationship between each infant capacity and later apprenticeship learning is demonstrated in examples from present-day research, specifically, research in the areas of medicine, sport, music, and tailoring, and research carried out by philosophers on apprenticeship learning.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445279;wos569;A theory of marks and mind: the effect of notational systems on hominid brain evolution and child development with an emphasis on exchanges between mothers and children;Sheridan S R;Journal Article;"A model of human language requires a theroy of meaningful marks. Humans are the only species who use marks to think. A theory of marks identifies children's scribbles as significant behavior, while hypothesizing the importance of rotational systems to hominid brain evolution. By recognizing the importance of children's scribbles and drawings in developmental terms as well as in evolutionary terms, a marks-based rather than a predominantly speech-based theory of the human brain, language, and consciousness emerges. Combined research in anthropology, primatology, art history, neurology, child development (including research with deaf and blind children), gender studies and literacy suggests the importance of notational systems to human language, revealing the importance of mother/child interactions around marks and sounds to the development of an expressive, communicative, symbolic human brain.An understanding of human language is enriched by identifying marks carved on bone 1.9 million years ago as observational Lunar calender-keeping, pushing proto-literacy back dramatically. Neurologically, children recapitulate the meaningful marks of early hominins when they scribble and draw, reminding us that Literacy belongs to humankind's earliest history. Even more than speech, such meaningful marks played - and continue to play - decisive roles in human brain evolution. The hominid brain required a model for integrative, transformative neural transfer. The research strongly suggests that humankind's multiple literacies (art, Literature, scientific writing, mathematics and music) depended upon dyadic exchanges between hominid mothers and children, and that this exchange and sharing of visuo-spatial information drove the elaboration of human speech in terms of syntax, grammar and vocabulary. The human brain was spatial before it was Linguistic. The child scribbles and draws before it speaks or writes. Children babble and scribble within the first two years of life. Hands and mouths are proximal on the sensory-motor cortex. Gestures accompany speech. Illiterate brains mis-pronounce nonsense sounds. Literate brains do not. Written language (work of the hands) enhances spoken language (work of the mouth). 


Until brain scans map the neurological links between human gesture, speech and marks in the context of mother/caregiver/child interactions, and research with literate and illiterate brains document even more precisely the longterm differences between these brains, the evolutionary pressure of marks on especially flexible maternal and infant brain tissue that occurred 1.9 million years, radically changing primate brain capabilities, requires an integrated theory of marks and mind.

They act as a backdrop against which all our claims to knowledge are judged as acceptable or not. As a result, it is not easy to articulate their inadequacies in a clear and forceful manner.

However, this notion lacks a systematic and nuanced definition. Treated intuitively, it has usually been seen as a verbal enterprise. By approaching storytelling from a cross disciplinary perspective, this paper aims at showing that, contrary to the common assumption, the human ability to tell stories is not restricted to the verbal medium. To show this, I define storytelling and provide a set of minimal criteria for a narrative act. Then, I proceed to identify these conditions in different semiotic resources - pictorial and gestural - to demonstrate that narrating can also transpire non-verbally and with the use of different modalities, mainly the visual, but also the vocal-auditory. I also point to the directions for further discussion of non-verbal narratives in the context of language evolution and the need for evolutionary research on storytelling to have a firm foundation in disciplines such as narratology.

However, in recent years, accumulating evidence from behavioural and neurobiological research has shown that both human and non-human primate communication is inherently multimodal. It is therefore timely to integrate the study of gestural and vocal communication. Herein, we review evidence demonstrating that there is no clear difference between primate gestures and vocalizations in the extent to which they show evidence for the presence of key language properties: intentionality, reference, iconicity and turn-taking. We also find high overlap in the neurobiological mechanisms producing primate gestures and vocalizations, as well as in ontogenetic flexibility. These findings confirm that human language had multimodal origins. Nonetheless, we note that in great apes, gestures seem to fulfil a carrying (i.e. predominantly informative) role in close-range communication, whereas the opposite holds for face-to-face interactions of humans. This suggests an evolutionary shift in the carrying role from the gestural to the vocal stream, and we explore this transition in the carrying modality. Finally, we suggest that future studies should focus on the links between complex communication, sociality and cooperative tendency to strengthen the study of language origins.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our analysis and interpretation of documents took into account the internal and external circumstances of the time, the ethnic, confessional and political particuliarities of Romanians inside the kingdom, the two-centuries long shaping of positive or negative stereotypes about Romanians It is known that, during the Middle Ages, there were different types of solidarity, leading to the images, the stereotypes about the 'others', the foreigners, the conquered ones, whose religion and confession were different to those of the conquerors, who belonged to another social structure, spoke a different language and had different origins. Romanians in Transylvania and outside the borders of the kingdom are generally presented in dark colours; they are the ones who set fires and rebel, they are killers and charismatic, in touch with the Romanians outside the Carpathian arch and, therefore, are not very reliable. The tone describing the Romanians gets tougher when diplomatic and military conflicts appear between the Kingdom of Hungary and Moldavia. In those moments, with few exceptions, the allegations againts Romanians increase in intensity and tone. In Transylvania, the Romanian knezes and princes competed for advantages from the king. The king was much more open to the knezes and princes willing to support the royal policy. The Hungarian sovereigns reconfirmed the privileges of some of them, while fewer others were raised to the true nobility of the kingdom. A part of the Romanian elite, however, acted against the central government, in various forms. The Hungarian kings acted differently towards the knezes and princes opposing central government. As for the monikers used especially for Romanians in Transylvania, and generally for those outside the borders, by the political power in the kingdom of Hungary, the main cause for the negative image of Romanians, as reflected in the official documents, it is due to the gestures and acts of disloyalty and treason by a part of of the Romanian elite in Transylvania and princes in Wallachia and Moldavia. The terms most frequently present in documents are: treachery, disloyalty, guile and infidelity. They are directly linked to the Romanian knezes' and princes' anti-royal actions.



Consequently, the main cause of the presence of these terms must be linked directly to the suzerainty-vassalage relations between the king of Hungary and the Romanian elite.

Since it involves competition, whereby one animal attempts to gain advantage over another, RT runs the risk of escalation to serious fighting. Competition is typically curtailed by some degree of cooperation and different signals help negotiate potential mishaps during RT. This review provides a framework for such signals, showing that they range along two dimensions: one from signals borrowed from other functional contexts to those that are unique to play, and the other from purely emotional expressions to highly cognitive (intentional) constructions. Some animal taxa have exaggerated the emotional and cognitive interplay aspects of play signals, yielding admixtures of communication that have led to complex forms of RT. This complexity has been further exaggerated in some lineages by the development of specific novel gestures that can be used to negotiate playful mood and entice reluctant partners. Play-derived gestures may provide new mechanisms by which more sophisticated communication forms can evolve. Therefore, RT and playful communication provide a window into the study of social cognition, emotional regulation and the evolution of communication systems.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444866;wos580;A tragic hero and its Lithuanian variety (a Maceina's neolithic apology with paleolithic prologue of tragic gesture);Sliogeris A;Journal Article;The paper deals with the origin of tragedy and with historical types of the tragic hero. Tragedy is treated not as a genre of literature but rather as an existential posture of a mortal vis-a-vis the Universality and its marginal expression and the only way of presence, i.e. Language. Similarly, tragedy is defined as a revolt of an individual against the Universality in any possible ways of its manifestation. It is asserted that the tragic gesture, in its most authentic manifestation and to some extent a unique form, emerged only in several Greek poleis and partly in the Republic of Rome. Greeks gave the world the purest examples of tragic revolt and the archetype of a tragic hero - a free and autonomous individual. Socrates can be Pericles, Alexander, and Cesar. Christianity and the so-called Modernity replace the metaphysical paradigm of the autonomous individual with that of a 'person' as a machine of Language and, consequently, as a representative of the Universality, thus destroying the very possibility of tragic gesture. It is futile to have any discussion about tragedy in the circumstances of religious and technological despotism. Though neither the anti-Greek West nor the despotic East can boast of a tragic hero, they still escalate the jargon of ideological gesture to replace the existential circumstances of the tragic hero with linguistic simulacres. In the focus of the second part of the article is Antanas Maceina as a figure of religious philosopher in the context of the tragic gesture. It is concluded that Antanas Maceina, despite some aspects of his life and thinking relatable to his philosophical posture, could be most treated only as a melodramatic figure.

Social grooming in primates is an example of an interaction that requires coordination between partners but little is known about communicative behaviours facilitating this activity. In this study, we analysed the communication of wild chimpanzees of Budongo Forest, Uganda, as they entered and maintained a naturally occurring cooperative interaction: social grooming. We found that lip-smacking, a distinct multimodal oral gesture produced during grooming, coordinated this activity. Lip-smacking at the beginning of grooming bouts was significantly more often followed by longer and reciprocated bouts than silent grooming initiations. Lip-smacks were more likely to be produced when the risk of termination of the interaction by the recipient was high, for instance when grooming vulnerable body parts. Groomers were also more likely to produce lip-smacks during face-to-face grooming where the visual aspect of the signal could be perceived. Data are consistent with the hypothesis that chimpanzee lip-smacks function to coordinate and prolong social grooming, suggesting that this oral signal is an example of a communicative behaviour facilitating cooperative behaviour in chimpanzees.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

WORKSHOP ON THE METHODOLOGY OF WORKER NOTIFICATION
This presentation offers historical and sociolinguistic perspectives regarding the origins of the language used by African-Americans. U.S. descendants of slaves of West and Niger Congo African origin should not be thought of as native speakers of English. To the extent that they have lived in de jure or de facto social isolation from Euro-American English-speaking persons, they have retained a West and Niger Congo African thought process or substratum in the phonology and morphosyntax of their speech. Their mother tongue has been described by several African-American linguists, psychologists, and ethnologists as Ebonics. In a sense, Ebonics refers to the paralinguistic verbal and non-verbal sounds, cues. and gestures that are systematically used in the process of communication by many African-Americans.

As one consequence of historical social isolation, African-Americans invariably score poorly on nationally standardized scales of ''Standard American'' English competence. Therefore, worker notification intended for African-Americans, especially among the blue- and no-collar levels, that does not contain an Afro-centric perspective will likely not prove successful. The linguistic factors, which can severely impede or tremendously enhance the effectiveness of worker notification to these groups, are therefore vital and should not be ignored. Worker notification targeted for limited English-speaking or unlettered populations should include the development of materials and presentations in the language or primary medium best understood by the audience. Based upon research findings on the psycholinguistics of learning modal preference, the development of notification materials that target a learning channel that is audio oral or aural-oral is promoted.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445611;wos585;The Structural and Functional Organization of Cognition;Snow P J;Journal Article;"This article proposes that what have been historically and contemporarily defined as different domains of human cognition are served by one of four functionally- and structurally-distinct areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC).

Given their unique contribution to human cognition, it is proposed that these areas be called the, social (BA9), material (BA47), abstract (BA46-9/46) and temporal (BA10) mind. The evidence that BA47 participates strongly in verbal and gestural communication suggests that language evolved primarily as a consequence of the extreme selective pressure for practicality; an observation supported by the functional connectivity between BA47 and orbital areas that negatively reinforce lying. It is further proposed that the abstract mind (BA46-9/46) is the primary seat of metacognition charged with creating adaptive behavioral strategies by generating higher-order concepts (hypotheses) from lower-order concepts originating from the other three domains of cognition.";Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In adult humans, gestures are thought to be a window into the thought processes accompanying language, and sign languages are equal to spoken language with all of its features. Some research firmly emphasises the differences between human gestures and those of other apes; however, the question about whether there are any commonalities is rarely investigated, and has mostly been confined to pointing gestures. The gestural repertoires of nonhuman ape species have been carefully studied and described with regard to their form and function-but similar approaches are much rarer in the study of human gestures. This paper applies the methodology commonly used in the study of nonhuman ape gestures to the gestural communication of human children in their second year of life. We recorded (n = 13) children's gestures in a natural setting with peers and caregivers in Germany and Uganda. Children employed 52 distinct gestures, 46 (89%) of which are present in the chimpanzee repertoire. Like chimpanzees, they used them both singly, and in sequences, and employed individual gestures flexibly towards different goals.";Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445497;wos587;Brain lateralization of complex movement: Neuropsychological evidence from unilateral stroke;"Flores-Medina Y; Chavez-Oliveros M; Medina LD; Rodriguez-Agudelo Y; Solis-Vivanco R";Journal Article;"Complex movement (CM) refers to the representation of a goal-oriented action and is classified as either transitive (use of tools) or intransitive (communication gestures). Both types of CM have three specific components: temporal, spatial, and content, which are subdivided into specific error types (SET). Since there is debate regarding the contribution of each brain hemisphere for the types of CM, our objective was to describe the brain lateralization of components and SET of transitive and intransitive CM. We studied 14 patients with a left hemisphere stroke (LH), 12 patients with a right hemisphere stroke (RH), and 16 control subjects. The Florida Apraxia Screening Test-Revised (FAST-R, Rothi et al., 1988) was used for the assessment of CM. Both clinical groups showed a worse performance than the control group on the total FAST-R and transitive movement scores (p<0.001). Failures in Spatial and Temporal components were found in both clinical groups, but only LH patients showed significantly more Content errors (p<0.01) than the control group. Also, only the LH group showed a higher number of errors for intransitive movements score (p=0.017), due to lower scores in the content component, compared to the control group (p=0.04). Transitive and intransitive CMs differ in their neurocognitive representation; transitive CM shows a bilateral distribution of its components when compared to intransitive CM, which shows a preferential left hemisphere representation. This could result from higher neurocognitive demands for movements that require use of tools, compared with more automatic communication gestures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

22444984;wos588;On Mimicry, Signs and Other Meaning-Making Acts Further Studies in Iconicity;Sonesson G;Journal Article;In an earlier paper, I set out to apply to animal mimicry the definition of the sign, and, more specifically, of the iconic sign, which I originally elaborated in the study of pictures, and which was then extended by myself and others to language, gesture, and music. The present contribution, however, while summarizing some of the results of those earlier studies, is dedicated to the demonstration that animal mimicry, as well as phenomena of the human Lifeworld comparable to it, are in a sense the opposite of signs. It has often been observed, not only within speech act philosophy, but also by the semiotician Luis Prieto, that as sign can only function as such once it is recognized to be a sign. Animal mimicry, camouflage, and the like, in contrast, only work as such, to the extent that they are not perceived as signs. Unlike what speech act philosophy claims, nevertheless, the difference which makes a difference is not the recognition of a purpose attributed to the subject producing the sign. A footprint, for example, has to be recognized as a sign in order to function as such. Nevertheless, to the extent that a purpose is attributed to the subject setting the sign, it may be considered a sign, but one that hides its nature, a fake footprint. Mimicry and camouflage, however, are similar to such natural meanings as footprints in entertaining a different relation to the agent initiating the act and the agent perceiving it. Classical studies of mimicry distinguish its varieties according to what is rather vaguely called function. In this paper, we will investigate whether these classifications can be recuperated from a semiotic point of view, or whether a semiotically valid classification should start from scratch.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23080861;wos589;High Gamma Oscillations in Medial Temporal Lobe during Overt Production of Speech and Gestures;"Marstaller L; Sowman P F;  Burianova H";Journal Article;The study of the production of co-speech gestures (CSGs), i.e., meaningful hand movements that often accompany speech during everyday discourse, provides an important opportunity to investigate the integration of language, action, and memory because of the semantic overlap between gesture movements and speech content. Behavioral studies of CSGs and speech suggest that they have a common base in memory and predict that overt production of both speech and CSGs would be preceded by neural activity related to memory processes. However, to date the neural correlates and timing of CSG production are still largely unknown. In the current study, we addressed these questions with magnetoencephalography and a semantic association paradigm in which participants overtly produced speech or gesture responses that were either meaningfully related to a stimulus or not. Using spectral and beamforming analyses to investigate the neural activity preceding the responses, we found a desynchronization in the beta band (15-25 Hz), which originated 900 ms prior to the onset of speech and was localized to motor and somatosensory regions in the cortex and cerebellum, as well as right inferior frontal gyrus. Beta desynchronization is often seen as an indicator of motor processing and thus reflects motor activity related to the hand movements that gestures add to speech. Furthermore, our results show oscillations in the high gamma band (50-90 Hz), which originated 400 ms prior to speech onset and were localized to the left medial temporal lobe. High gamma oscillations have previously been found to be involved in memory processes and we thus interpret them to be related to contextual association of semantic information in memory. The results of our study show that high gamma oscillations in medial temporal cortex play an important role in the binding of information in human memory during speech and CSG production.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The rapid evolution of computers' processing power, progress in projection and display technology, and their low cost, accompanied by recent advances in mathematical modeling, make available to space designers today sophisticated technologies which were once accessible only to research institutions or large companies. Thanks to wireless sensing techniques it is possible to endow a space with perceptual intelligence, and make it aware of how people use it, move in it, or react to it. Intelligent Spaces are relevant for several applications or tasks which range from surveillance to entertainment, from medical rehabilitation to artistic performance, from museum exhibit design to commerce. The author's work focuses on Narrative Spaces which are storytellers, able to articulate an informative or entertaining audio-visual narration for people interactively. Narrative Spaces communicate by use of large scale coordinated projections, sounds and displays whose contents are choreographed by the natural body movements or physical gestures of the people in them. This paper describes the guiding principles and modeling approaches that, according to the author, enable a robust modeling of user input and communication strategies for digital content presentation in Intelligent Narrative Spaces.

8th International Congress of Paediatric Otorhinolaryngology
Language developed for communication, to facilitate learning the use of tools and weapons, to plan hunting and defence, to develop a 'theory of mind' and the tools of thought, and to attract and keep a mate. The adaptations required took place over many millions of years. The first important one was left-sided specialisation of the neural apparatus controlling involuntary emotional vocalisations that began more than 200 million years ago. The next was the development in primates of 'mirror neurones' in the pre-motor cortex some 45 million years ago. These enabled the imitation and voluntary control of previously involuntary manual gestures and vocalisations. The third important adaptation was the descent of the larynx, 100,000 years ago, which greatly increased the phonological range of vocalisations that could be made. Thus, language did not develop all at once as suggested by Chomsky, but evolved gradually building upon adaptations originally meeting quite different needs.

His output consists of a limited series of woodcuts executed over the space of a few years, between 1935 and 1944, although the artist carried on working on the original blocks after this time, making changes that were Often connected with situations and social and political developments in his country.
His art is closely bound up with the peasant world, with the figures of the gaucho and the curandero. It is an art saturated with the beliefs, legends,fears and gestures of rural Uruguay in the first fifty years of the 20th century, remote from the Europeanized and cultured city of Montevideo. A world in which the magical mentality held sway over the scientific one, a universe made up of meaningful symbols and signs. Gonzalez was a profound interpreter of this culture, but also a penetrating critic and acute observer of historic and social developments, from the conquest to the dictatorship and the conditions of the rural population. It should not be forgotten that these were the years of Realismo social, an artistic movement that spread through much of Latin America, even though Gonzalez never played an active part in any artistic or political group and cannot be lumped with any of them. Bound to the earth, to trees and their wood (whence the choice of xylography as a medium) and to his people, whom he portrayed in a manner that could be grotesque but was always profound, he created works that were characterized by the force of the signs, of the symbols that he used, and by their capacity to say everything about a microcosm in a few essential lines, with rare efficacy and power.
His is a 'handmade art,' in the fullest and most consistent sense, an art that seeks and reestablishes contact with reality, with life, with the material and with an ancient culture-filled with meaning.

Fifty mothers completed the Adult Attachment Interview (Dynamic Maturational Model) during the third trimester of pregnancy. Mothers returned with their infants 7 months postpartum and completed a modified still-face procedure. While direct mirroring did not distinguish between secure and insecure/dismissing mothers, secure mothers were observed to engage in intention mirroring more than twice as frequently as did insecure/dismissing mothers. Infants of the two mother groups also demonstrated differences, with infants of secure mothers directing their attention toward their mothers at a higher frequency than did infants of insecure/dismissing mothers. The findings underscore marked and ostensive verbalization as a distinguishing feature of secure mothers' well-attuned, affect-mirroring communication with their infants. (C) 2014 The Authors.

22445530;wos599;The Relationship between Phoneme Production and Perception in Speech-Impaired and Typically-Developing Children;"Stromswold K; Lichtenstein A";Journal Article;One of the central questions that Eric Lenneberg raised in his seminal book, Biological Foundations of Language is: What is the relationship between language comprehension and language production? This paper reviews Lenneberg's case study of a child with congenital anarthria and then presents the results of two studies that investigate the relationship between phoneme perception and production. The first study investigates the phoneme identification skills of a child with developmental apraxia who, like the anarthric child studied by Lenneberg, had essentially no speech yet had no difficulty understanding speech. The second study investigates the extent to which 28 typically-developing children's ability to identify phonemes is related to their ability to produce phonemes. The results of both studies support Lenneberg's conclusion that children's ability to perceive speech is not dependent on their ability to produce speech. Thus, Lenneberg's original case study and the two studies presented in this paper argue against gestural theories of speech perception such as the Motor Theory.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

From this overview we draw the conclusion that computer-based systems designed to support communicating and archiving dynamic visual information should focus on the following features:
. Support dynamic language elements on a structural level in addition to traditional animated icons;
. Incorporate gestural language elements ( inspired by natural sign languages) anticipating future ways of human-computer interaction;

22445617;wos602;The evolution of oral speech etiquette in Russia in the 14th-17th centuries;Sudakov G V;Journal Article;"The article aims to study Russian verbal etiquette in the oral communication from the middle of the 16th century to the beginning of the 18th century, that is the period during which socio-economic, historical and cultural challenges accelerated the creating of universal norms in both written and oral speech in the form of a dialogue. Oral etiquette of Moscow Rus has not been studied yet. The sources of the research include texts of bilingual vocabularies, or phrasebooks (German-Russian, French-Russian, and English-Russian). In the article, seven phrasebooks (out of fifteen identified ones) are described. The phrasebooks present the forms of everyday communication - from greetings and the beginning of the verbal contact to the expressing of gratitude and farewell. The material of the research (bilingual texts) has determined the use of the comparative method; the study of etiquette formulae is based on the methods of contextual lexico-semantic analysis; the study of verbal interaction is relied on the theory of communicative tactics. The research was carried out in three stages. At the first stage, based on the speech etiquette theory, the register of possible speech situations was compiled, and the corresponding etiquette formulae were chosen from the texts of the phrasebooks. At the second stage of the research, the development of every etiquette formulae was described for the period of two centuries, as well as the semantics and connotation of the lexico-phraseological units used by the participants in the dialogues. At the final stage of the research, the etiquette formulae were studied in the cognitive aspect against the background of the cultural situation of the century and the mentality of the Russian people. According to the research results, in the process of communication, the oral etiquette formulae are used to establish the verbal contact, to identify the addressee and to appeal to the interlocutor. Hence, Russian speech etiquette has developed formulae of greeting, addressing, request, gratitude, good-wishing, having meals, farewell. The greetings are developed from the verbalized gesture (klan'ayus', lit. '<I am> bowing') to asking for informing (kak bog milujet? [how are you?]) and-later-expressing good wishes (bud' zdorov, lit. 'be healthy'). The study has showed that these factors determined the unique richness of the semantics of Russian greeting formulae, which included an appeal, a form of acquaintance, a greeting in the narrow sense, a verbal demonstration of the interest to the interlocutor and blessings for health, goodness and God's mercy. The research has revealed that Russian speech etiquette contains important means of the verbal contact for maintaining a harmonious dialogue. For the first time, the study of the verbal expressions of request has been made, and it has been discovered that in the 17th century, the request form included the word pozhaluy, from which the era of pozhaluysta [please] began in the Russian language. A distinctive feature of Russian medieval communication is the use of well-being formulae, usually associated with gratitude. According to the research results, the system of Russian etiquette is a dynamic unity of verbal elements, which are actualized and semantically enriched under the influence of sociocultural changes or stayed only in the history of the language.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our system, Toss-it, enables a user to send information from the user's PDA to other electronic devices with a 'toss' or 'swing' action, like a user would toss a ball or deal cards to others. The implementation of Toss-It consists of three principle parts - gesture recognition, location recognition, and file transfer.

22445546;wos604;Ball in the light of the concept of the game J Huizinga;Svetlana E;Journal Article;"Ball culture is one of the most popular topics in historical, culturological and art studies of late XX - early XXI century. Key choreographic aspect of balls was considered by many theorists and practitioners of the art of dance, but the priority was given to the methodical direction of investigation, resulting in numerous verbal graphic records of ballroom dances (M. Ivanovsky, M. Vasilieva-Rozhdestvenska, A. Shulgin, etc). And although art theoretical works on the subject appeared recently (O.Zakharov, A. Kolesnikov, E. Uvarov, etc.), there is no comprehensive study established, specifically dedicated to the ballroom-dancing culture itself (in the original sense of the term 'ballroom dance', excluding derivative forms and contemporary dance sport). Deviation from specialty methodolog. and development of a conceptual level of ballroom dance studies is one of the most crucial issues of choreology.



The article substantiates an extrapolation of the main points of Johan Huizinga's play-concept into ballroom-dancing culture.



Play and dance cultures closely intersect in the genesis, thus we can suggest a certain similarity in their properties. The play was expressing itself in many elements of ballroom etiquette - in costume, accessories, demeanour, gestures, etc.



Under the play we understand the type of non-productive free activity, which encloses a forgotten symbolic meaning, unfolds in the special space and time in the form of either competition or performance (role playing) of different situations according to voluntarily accepted but steadily followed rules and is opposed to utilitarian practical activity. Fundamental points for determination are based on the fundamental culturological concept of the play by the Dutch historian and culture expert, Johan Huizinga. Extrapolating the main features of the play defined by Huizinga in the ball scope, we can consider to some extent both the whole ball system and its separate component, namely ballroom dancing, as a play.



According to Huizinga, the play is based on imaginative transformation of reality, on attempt to reveal these images in the play. If we consider etiquette requirements for persons of different sex, age, social status, etc., we can speak about certain 'imaginative' roles, whose interaction leads to the formation of the integral play complex of ball.



Any play, according to Huizinga, is a free expression of a person, a forced action can not be a play. Despite some difficulties with the introduction of balls in the time of Peter I and their further standartizaion, participants attended them on their own volition, in fact, with pleasure.



The repetition, according to Huizinga, is a significant feature of the play, which spreads not only on the play itself (a ball can be repeated many times on the same rules), but also on its internal structure (repetition of certain fragments of passages, figures, dances on tanzmeister's instruction).



The space limitation is even more distinctive than the time limition, since any play takes place in a predetermined play space, where there are special rules. The play space inside is predominated by a characteristic perfect order. A certain duality of ball (strict regulation in combination with certain liberties, desire for freedom) can be distinguished.



Strain is one of the leading features of the play, the strain element is veiled at the ball, but present (the desire to be the best performer of the dance, to get a partner who you feel sympathetic to, to gain fame, to establish contacts for further settlement of family, employment, financial problems, etc.).



Each play has its own rules, different rules are inherent for court balls, masquerade balls, charitable, and social ones, etc.



The dance, according to Huizinga, is actually a play in the full sense of the word, moreover, is one of the purest and most advanced its forms. He considers dances, performed by the dance couple at the ball, to be the best example for play features, because there is a rhythmic alignment and a move, e.g. in the quadrille or minuet.



Among the main features of the play, attributing balls to the form of the play activity, there can be distinguished a certain degree of abstraction, freedom from daily life; material non-motivation, absence of pragmatic interests; performance in a designated space and time, according to the certain rules. The entire ball system can be considered as a play, each element of the system (core - dancing itself, costumes, verbal and non-verbal communication, etc.) can be considered as an element of the play and as a standalone play.

22445005;wos605;Mystical soundscapes in Stefans Grove's music with specific reference to his Haunting Music for piano;Swart I;Journal Article;"Stefans Grove's compositional ideas often come to him in dreams. This article explores the processes inherent in the creation, re-creation by the performer, and appreciation of Grove's unique soundscapes, where the silences between the notes and the overtones are often as important as the dissonances - which he describes as 'colourful harmonies' - themselves.
Grove's music is often regarded as relatively inaccessible and elusive. This article explores how it can be better understood if the listener can develop the ability to appreciate its programmatic nature, to draw on strong visual imagination when 'translating' sound into images, and to approach his music with openness to non-traditional structures and harmonies. Only by these means can access be gained to the richness of the mystical soundscapes and musical imagery.
Primarily an autodidact, the 90-year-old Grove underwent a gradual stylistic transformation during his career; his oeuvre ranged from music rooted in the neo-classical, impressionist and expressionist styles of the Western tradition, to the predominantly African inspiration of the post-1984 period. The transitions between these periods are not sharply demarcated but rather constitute a gradual development. Neither is his African-inspired style exclusive of the other styles, as is evident in such recent works as 8 Lieder nach Texten von Conrad Meyer for soprano, flute and piano (2007) and Haunting Music (2010). The latter, a work for solo piano, has strong similarities to Gaspard de la nuit by Maurice Ravel. Both works belong to the impressionist style, both are programmatic works and both contain strong mystical elements. Fascinated by the supernatural, Grove chose a fantastical programme for this work, which consists of three separate pieces, namely Strange valley of the mists, Wandering through an enchanted forest and Hobgoblin at midnight The work by Maurice Ravel, in turn, is based on three phantasmagoric poems by Aloysius Bertrand, namely Ondine, Le Gibet and Scarbo, which deal respectively with a water nymph, a man on the gallows, and an evil dwarf. Grove briefly alluded to drawing inspiration from Ravel but later denied this - an argument is made for musical borrowing at the subconscious level. Similarities between the works are not to be found in the melodic material per se, but in melodic gestures, rhythm, character; style and programmatic content. Correspondences in the first piece include falling melodic opening motifs, the evocation of water and mists through shimmering effects and similar accompaniment patterns; in the second, notated in both cases on three staves, rhythmically almost identical pedal points, representing the knocking of the hanged man's feet against the gallows and footsteps through a forest respectively; and in the second and third pieces, the complete fading away of sound at the end. A diabolical nocturnal apparition provides the inspiration for both the third pieces; in both, the composer uses pianistic acrobatics encompassing a wide range on the keyboard.
If properly understood, the complexities and dynamics inherent in the creation of Grove's music can be translated effectively by the performer into the soundscapes that originated in the composer's imagination. This entails a process of 're-creation' by the performer.
The author first encountered Grove as a lecturer in her class at the University of Pretoria, and she later, as a performer and exponent of his works, received generous guidance from the composer himself The article is interspersed with four Vignettes depicting the circumstances at the time. As in Grove's own use of chain form, the Vignettes look first forward and then back in chronological time. Essential elements in the performance of his music, as illustrated throughout in the comparison of these works, include the exquisite control of sound and overtones, the ability to create a rich variety of timbres, the dramatic use of silence, a secure sense of rhythm and fluency in articulation.
The processes of 'creation', 're-creation' and 'appreciation' all entail application of the mind, not least on the part of the listener The mystical in Grove's music can be appreciated through a thorough understanding of the programme which inspired any given creation, keeping track of the permutations of the original germ cells throughout a work, and imagining what can happen but has not necessarily happened. In Strange valley of the mists, according to Grove himself, the imagination must lead to what the listener thinks is there, and not to what he or she sees.
Grove draws inspiration from indigenous African music and cultures, and especially from Venda legends. Many scholars and performers regard Stefans Grove as one of the most important composers in Africa. He has an unlimited musical imagination with regard to sources from which he chooses to draw upon for inspiration, his musical language and the creation of unconventional sounds and structures. By transcending our traditional way of listening to music, we can gain access to his special soundscapes and unique musical idiom.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444949;wos606;The effects of visual beats on prosodic prominence: Acoustic analyses, auditory perception and visual perception;"Krahmer E; Swerts M";Journal Article;Speakers employ acoustic cues (pitch accents) to indicate that a word is important, but may also use visual cues (beat gestures, head nods, eyebrow movements) for this purpose. Even though these acoustic and visual cues are related, the exact nature of this relationship is far from well understood. We investigate whether producing a visual beat leads to changes in how acoustic prominence is realized in speech, and whether it leads to changes in how prominence is perceived by observers. For Experiment I ('making beats') we use an original experimental paradigm in which speakers are instructed to realize a target sentence with different distributions of acoustic and visual cues for prominence. Acoustic analyses reveal that the production of a visual beat indeed has an effect on the acoustic realization of the co-occurring speech, in particular on duration and the higher formants (F-2 and F-3), independent of the kind of visual beat and of the presence and position of pitch accents. In Experiment II ('hearing beats'), it is found that visual beats have a significant effect on the perceived prominence of the target words. When a speaker produces a beat gesture, an eyebrow movement or a head nod, the accompanying word is produced with relatively more spoken emphasis. In Experiment III ('seeing beats'), finally, it is found that when participants see a speaker realize a visual beat on a word, they perceive it as more prominent than when they do not see the beat gesture.

The emergence of shared symbol systems is considered to be a pivotal moment in human evolution and human development. These changes are normally explained by reference to changes in people's internal cognitive processes. We present 2 experiments which provide evidence that changes in the external, collaborative processes that people use to communicate can also affect the structure and organization of symbol systems independently of cognitive change. We propose that mutual-modifiability - opportunities for people to edit or manipulate each other's contributions-is a key constraint on the emergence of complex symbol systems.

Infants of all three ethnicities responded within 3sec of mothers' language and gestures, increased their responsiveness over development, and displayed specificity in their responses: They vocalized and gestured following mothers' referential language and gestures, but were less likely than chance to communicate following mothers' regulatory language.

22445241;wos609;How leaders influence followers through the use of nonverbal communication;"Talley L; Temple S";Journal Article;"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address the relationship between a leader's use of nonverbal immediacy (specific hand gestures) and followers' attraction to the leader. This study provides initial evidence that certain hand gestures are more effective than others at creating immediacy between leaders and followers.
Design/methodology/approach - In an experimental study, participants (male = 89; female = 121) were shown one of three videos of an actor, as leader, using three positive hand gestures, three defensive hand gestures, and no hand gestures, which have not been previously operationalized (and were grouped arbitrarily by the experimenter). Three hypotheses were tested using a 3 x 2 ANOVA (by group and gender) for main and interactional effects.
Findings - The independent variable, positive hand gestures (M = 2.4), was perceived by participants as more immediate than the other two independent variables, defensive hand gestures (M = -19.2) or no hand gestures (M = -21.6). Analysis of data indicate that participants perceived leaders with no hand gestures and defensive hand gestures to be distant or non-immediate and the leader with positive hand gestures to be more immediate or attractive.
Research limitations/implications - This study is limited as a pilot study establishing differences between specific hand gestures for the first time.
Practical implications - The research provides initial evidence that the hand gestures arbitrarily defined as 'positive' create more immediacy between the followers and the leader than usage of 'negative' gestures and no gestures.
Social implications - The current research can act as a motivator for leaders to fast forward relationships with followers through the use of specific hand gestures.
Originality/value - The results suggest the possibility that some hand gestures are more effective than others.";Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

22445707;wos614;Moving beyond 'meaning': Gorillas combine gestures into sequences for creative display;"Tanner J E; Perlman M";Journal Article;"The great apes produce gestures intentionally and flexibly, and sometimes they combine their gestures into sequences, producing two or more gestures in close succession. We re-evaluate previous findings related to ape gesture sequences and present qualitative analysis of videotaped gorilla interaction. We present evidence that gorillas produce at least two different kinds of gesture sequences: some sequences are largely composed of gestures that depict motion in an iconic manner, typically requesting particular action by the partner; others are multimodal and contain gestures - often percussive in nature - that are performed in situations of play or display. Display sequences seem to primarily exhibit the performer's emotional state and physical fitness but have no immediate functional goal. Analysis reveals that some gorilla play and display sequences can be 1) organized hierarchically into longer bouts and repetitions; 2) innovative and individualized, incorporating objects and environmental features; and 3) highly interactive between partners. It is illuminating to look beyond 'meaning' in the conventional linguistic sense and look at the possibility that characteristics of music and dance, as well as those of language, are included in the gesturing of apes.

Our approach augments the original data by generating more perspective views, which makes the training more effective and reduces the potential overfitting. During the inference step, our approach comprehends information from multiple views for the final prediction to address the confusing cases caused by orientational variations and partial occlusions.

23080885;wos616;The effect of simulated visual impairment on speech-reading ability;"Dickinson C M; Taylor J";Journal Article;"Purpose: Speech-reading is the ability to recognise certain sounds visually, using both the movements of the speaker's mouth, plus other sources of visual information, such as gestures and body language, facial expressions and situational clues. This study aimed to determine the effect of mild degrees of visual impairment on speech-reading ability.
Method: A group of 15 normally-sighted subjects was assessed with different levels of simulated visual loss using occlusion foils, in the presence of constant background noise to simulate hearing loss. The visual impairments created ranged from 20 to 13 dB log contrast sensitivity (contrast thresholds 1-5%) (measured using the backlit Melbourne Edge Test) with acuity dropping from 6/6 to 6/24 (logMAR 0.0-0.6). The speech-reading ability with simulated impairment and noise was quantified as the number of words recognised correctly when watching a video of an actor speaking meaningful sentences.
Results: The introduction of the mildest simulated visual impairment (VA 6/6 logMAR 0.0; contrast sensitivity 20 dB, contrast threshold 1%) was sufficient to cause a statistically significant reduction in speech-reading ability (t-test, p < 0.001), and as the level of visual impairment was increased, the speech-reading ability became progressively worse throughout the range of impairments tested.
Conclusions: This study shows that if hearing is compromised, then an observer's speech-reading ability is sensitive to changes in vision. It is likely that visual loss will have consequences for speech-reading ability. This will be particularly relevant to the elderly population who are often found to have a dual sensory loss that causes compromise to both visual and auditory sensory reception. Some of the difficulties in communication reported by the elderly with reduced hearing could be visual as opposed to auditory in origin.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here, we focus on arguably the most complex basic form, denial, and how young children understand denial, when it is expressed in response to a question with gesture, single word, or sentence. One hundred twenty-six children in 3 age groups (Ms = 1 year 9 months, 2 years 0 months, and 2 years 4 months) witnessed an adult look into 1 of 2 buckets and then, in response to a question about whether the toy was in there, communicate either something positive (positive head nod, 'yes,' 'it is in this bucket') or negative (negative head shake, 'No,' 'It's not in this bucket'). The youngest children did not search differently in response to any of the communicative cues (nor in response to an additional cue using both gesture and single word). Children at 2 years 0 months searched at above-chance levels only in response to the negative word and negative sentence. Children at 2 years 4 months were successful with all 3 types of cues in both positive and negative modalities, with the exception of the positive sentence. Young children thus seem to understand the denial of a statement before they understand its affirmation, and they understand linguistic means of expressing denial before they understand gestural means.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The ability to use gestures declaratively has been linked to later language development; therefore, it is important to understand the origins of this motive. Previous research has focused on the use of declarative pointing at around 12 months; however, other potential forms of declarative communication, such as holdout gestures, are yet to be studied in detail. The purpose of this study was to examine whether from 10 months, infants use holdouts declaratively. We elicited holdouts from 36 infants and then reacted to these gestures in four different conditions: (1) joint attention: shared interest; (2) infant attention: attended to infant; (3) toy attention: attended to toy; (4) ignore: gesture was not attended to. Infants' behavioral responses were recorded. When the experimenter engaged in joint attention, infants were significantly more likely to display a positive attitude and produced fewer re-engagement attempts. In contrast, the three non-joint attention conditions displayed significantly higher negative attitudes and attempts to re-engage the experimenter. We conclude that infants display declarative communication prior to 12 months, resetting the age at which these more complex skills emerge.";Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23080810;wos621;Reaching and grasping with the tongue: Shared motor planning between hand actions and articulatory gestures;"Vainio L; Tiippana K; Tiainen M;  Rantala A; Vainio M";Journal Article;Research has shown connections between articulatory mouth actions and manual actions. This study investigates whether forward-backward hand movements could be associated with vowel production processes that programme tongue fronting/backing, lip rounding/spreading (Experiment 1), and/or consonant production processes that programme tongue tip and tongue dorsum actions (Experiment 2). The participants had to perform either forward or backward hand movement and simultaneously pronounce different vowels or consonants. The results revealed a response benefit, measured in vocal and manual reaction times, when the responses consisted of front vowels and forward hand movements. Conversely, back vowels were associated with backward hand movements. Articulation of rounded versus unrounded vowels or coronal versus dorsal consonants did not produce the effect. In contrast, when the manual responses of forward-backward hand movements were replaced by precision and power grip responses, the coronal consonants [t] and [r] were associated with the precision grip, whereas the dorsal consonant [k] was associated with the power grip. We propose that the movements of the tongue body, operating mainly for vowel production, share the directional action planning processes with the hand movements.

Here we studied whether these effects generalize to another language, namely Czech. We reasoned that if the results generalized to another language environment, it would suggest that the effects arise through other processes than language-dependent semantic associations. Rather, the effects would be likely to arise through language-independent interactions between processes that plan articulatory gestures and hand movements. Participants were presented with visual stimuli specifying articulations to be uttered (e.g., A or I), and they were required to produce a manual response concurrently with the articulation. In Experiment 1 they responded with a precision or a power grip, whereas in Experiment 2 they responded with a forward or a backward hand movement. The grip congruency effect was fully replicated: the consonant [k] and the vowel [alpha] were associated with power grip responses, while the consonant [t] and the vowel [i] were associated with precision grip responses. The forward/backward congruency effect was replicated with vowels [alpha], [o], which were associated with backward movement and with [ i], which was associated with forward movement, but not with consonants [k] and [ t]. These findings suggest that the congruency effects mostly reflect interaction between processes that plan articulatory gestures and hand movements with an exception that the forward/backward congruency effect might only work with vowel articulation.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445433;wos623;Two hypotheses on primate cognition;Tomasello M;Journal Article;"Two hypotheses about primate cognition are proposed. First, it is proposed that primates, but not other mammals, understand categories of relations among external entities. In the physical domain, primates have special skills in tasks such as oddity, transitivity, and relation matching that require facility with relational categories; in the social domain, primates have special skills in understanding the third-party social relationships that hold among other individuals in their groups. Second, it is proposed that humans, but not other primates, understand the causal and intentional relations that hold among external entities. In the physical domain only humans understand causal forces as mediating the connection between sequentially ordered events; in the social domain only humans understand the behavior of others as intentionally directed and controlled by desired outcomes. Intentional/causal understanding of this type opens the way for cumulative cultural evolution (the ratchet effect), which is responsible for many of humans' most distinctive cognitive skills and products. Both these uniquely primate and these uniquely human cognitive skills are hypothesized to have their origins in adaptations for negotiating complex social interactions.

Overall, the most important differences between the gestures of typically developing children and the gestures of individuals from the other three groups concern: (1) their predominant use of triadic, distal gestures; (2) their extensive use of declarative gestures, and (3) their use of imitative learning in acquiring some gestures (symbolic or referential), which implies that the gestures are understood as bi-directional communicative conventions. These differences all derive from the uniquely human form of social cognition (i.e., knowledge of other minds) that first emerges during the 2nd year of life and that enables human infants to understand other persons as intentional agents with whom they may share experience, Implications for the origins and evolution of human culture and language are discussed.";Included;Excluded;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Despite extensive research on chimpanzee communication, there is little evidence that chimpanzees are capable, without extensive human training, of regulating collaborative activities via communication. This study investigated whether pairs of chimpanzees were capable of communicating to ensure coordination during collaborative problem-solving. The chimpanzee pairs needed two tools to extract fruits from an apparatus. The communicator in each pair could see the location of the tools (hidden in one of two boxes), whereas only the recipient could open the boxes. The subjects were first successfully tested for their capacity to understand the pointing gestures of a human who indicated the location of the tools. In a subsequent conspecifics test, the communicator increasingly communicated the tools' location, by approaching the baited box and giving the key needed to open it to the recipients. The recipient used these signals and obtained the tools, transferring one of the tools to the communicator so that the pair could collaborate in obtaining the fruits. The study suggests that chimpanzees have the necessary socio-cognitive skills to naturally develop a simple communicative strategy to ensure coordination in a collaborative task.;Included;Excluded;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To investigate the developmental processes of this ability, we conducted an object-choice task by using longitudinal methods with infant chimpanzees tested from 8 months old until 3 years old. The experimenter used one of six gestures towards a cup concealing food; tapping, touching, whole-hand pointing, gazing plus close-pointing, distant-pointing, close-gazing, and distant-gazing. Unlike any other previous study, we analyzed the behavioral changes that occurred before and after choosing the cup. We assumed that pre-choice behavior indicates the development of an attentional and spatial connection between a pointing cue and an object (e.g. Woodward, 2005); and post-choice behavior indicates the emergence of object permanence (e.g. Piaget, 1954). Our study demonstrated that infant chimpanzees begin to use experimenter-given cues with age (after 11 months of age). Moreover, the results from the behavioral analysis showed that the infants gradually developed the spatial link between the pointing as an object-directed action and the object. Moreover, when they were 11 months old, the infants began to inspect the inside of the cup, suggesting the onset of object permanence. Overall, our results imply that the ability to use the cues is developing and mutually related with other cognitive developments. The present study also suggests what the standard object-choice task actually measures by breaking the task down into the developmental trajectories of its component parts, and describes for the first time the social-physical cognitive development during the task with a longitudinal method.";Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

22445457;wos634;Lateral asymmetries in infancy: Implications for the development of the hemispheres;Trevarthen C;Journal Article;Cerebral asymmetry of cognitive processing of stimulus information is commonly viewed as a neocortical phenomenon. However, a number of lines of evidence give innate asymmetry of brainstem motivating systems, which anticipate experience, a key role. Spontaneous asymmetries of gesture and emotion can be observed in infants, who entirely lack language and visuoconstructive skills. Motives for communication in early life may direct subsequent development of complementary cognitive systems in left and right hemispheres. In split-brain monkeys, lateralized motive sets, intentions for manipulation by one hand, can determine which hemisphere will see and learn. Evolutionary antecedents of cerebral asymmetry appear to affect motivation, social signalling and bimanual coordination, with secondary effects in perceptual processing and learning. The hemispheres of adult humans differ in links with neurochemical systems that regulate motor initiatives, exploration and attention, and the approach/withdrawal balance in social encounters. Asymmetries in emotional and communicative behaviour in infancy support evidence that an Intrinsic Motive Formation emerging in the embryo human brain stem regulates asymmetries in development and in functioning of the cerebral cortex.

With age dynamics of children there was observed a significant increase in the degree of similarity of the spatial structure of interregional relations during periods of performance of stereognostical test with patterns of changes in the EEG distant relationships revealed at performance of verbal tasks. In turn, similarity of patterns of interregional EEG relationships characteristic of stereognostical tasks with the patterns revealed at periods of performance of the tapping test was not increased with age. On the whole, the obtained data allow believing that with increase of children's age there rose the degree of topological similarity of the spatial structure of systemic interactions of the cortex zones, on which there were 'supported' processes of realization of stereognostical and verbal functions. The progressing increase with children's age of the degree of similarity of the distributive organization of neurophysiological mechanisms of central provision of the verbal and stereognostic functions can argue in favor of the concept of correlative formation of these higher psychical functions in postnatal ontogenesis. The obtained data show that the correlative interfunctional interactions promoting progressive development of cognitive functions in the child ontogenesis can be realized through the long association fibers and commissural pathways composing the morphofunctional longitudinal-transversal 'skeleton' of neocortex in the close interaction with thalamo-cortical integrative systems.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445687;wos637;Dynamics of media presentation of one literary phenomenon;"Galimova E S; Tsvetova N S";Journal Article;The article deals with literary criticism and art-PR treated as one of the key art-segments of the contemporary Russian media space. The relevance of the article is determined by the fact that the past studies of the Russian system of literary criticism as a key instrument for formation of the art discourse in the public sphere were carried out at the beginning of the new century. In this paper, we study the specifics of the dynamics of the communication space, which has been created by a heterogeneous media as the contextual or background for the so-called village prose. The latter one is recognized by literary historians as the most significant literary phenomenon of the second half of the last century. The authors conclude that the obvious change of communicative conditions for the existence of the village prose is connected not only with the changing situation in the media or changing the settings of the readership, but also with the institutional characteristics of this literary phenomenon. The authors have identified a specialized segment of the Russian media space preventing the domination of the PR component, which, in its turn, is programmed by the market dominance, actualizing traditional for the Russian literary criticism journalistic focus on ontological issues, ability to provoke awareness of socially significant events and gestures, and formatting literary discourse of media space. On the other hand, the formed discourse pragmatic aspirations of the modern professional literary criticism and journalistic community provoke the improvement of the status of a reader's statements about the work of art.

22445454;wos638;Posture labeling based gesture classification for Turkish sign language using depth values;"Saykol E; Ture H T; Sirvanci A M; Turan M";Journal Article;"Purpose - The purpose of this paper to classify a set of Turkish sign language (TSL) gestures by posture labeling based finite-state automata (FSA) that utilize depth values in location-based features. Gesture classification/recognition is crucial not only in communicating visually impaired people but also for educational purposes. The paper also demonstrates the practical use of the techniques for TSL.
Design/methodology/approach - Gesture classification is based on the sequence of posture labels that are assigned by location-based features, which are invariant under rotation and scale. Grid-based signing space clustering scheme is proposed to guide the feature extraction step. Gestures are then recognized by FSA that process temporally ordered posture labels.
Findings - Gesture classification accuracies and posture labeling performance are compared to k-nearest neighbor to show that the technique provides a reasonable framework for recognition of TSL gestures. A challenging set of gestures is tested, however the technique is extendible, and extending the training set will increase the performance.
Practical implications - The outcomes can be utilized as a system for educational purposes especially for visually impaired children. Besides, a communication system would be designed based on this framework.
Originality/value - The posture labeling scheme, which is inspired from keyframe labeling concept of video processing, is the original part of the proposed gesture classification framework. The search space is reduced to single dimension instead of 3D signing space, which also facilitates design of recognition schemes. Grid-based clustering scheme and location-based features are also new and depth values are received from Kinect.

22445171;wos639;Interactive editing in French Sign Language dedicated to virtual signers: requirements and challenges;"Gibet S; Lefebvre-Albaret F; Hamon L; Brun R; Turki A";Journal Article;Signing avatars are increasingly used as an interface for communication to the deaf community. In recent years, an emerging approach uses captured data to edit and generate sign language (SL) gestures. Thanks to motion editing operations (e.g., concatenation, mixing), this method offers the possibility to compose new utterances, thus facilitating the enrichment of the original corpus, enhancing the natural look of the animation, and promoting the avatar's acceptability. However, designing such an editing system raises many questions. In particular, manipulating existing movements does not guarantee the semantic consistency of the reconstructed actions. A solution is to insert the human operator in a loop for constructing new utterances and to incorporate within the utterance's structure constraints that are derived from linguistic patterns. This article discusses the main requirements for the whole pipeline design of interactive virtual signers, including: (1) the creation of corpora, (2) the needed resources for motion recording, (3) the annotation process as the heart of the SL editing process, (4) the building, indexing, and querying of a motion database, (5) the virtual avatar animation by editing and composing motion segments, and (6) the conception of a dedicated user interface according to user' knowledge and abilities. Each step is illustrated by the authors' recent work and results from the project Sign3D, i.e., an editing system of French Sign Language (LSF) content (http://sign3d.websourd.org/sltat).;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445482;wos640;Tools and talk: an evolutionary perspective on the functional deficits associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;"Eisen A; Turner MR; Lemon R";Journal Article;"We propose that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia may be viewed as a failure of interlinked functional complexes having their origins in key evolutionary adaptations. We discuss how hand-arm function, locomotion, brainstem function (involving vocalization/speech, swallowing and breathing), and cognitive impairment share complex, interdependent evolutionary adaptations that can be traced back several million years. Fine movements of the hand facilitated tool-making and use enhanced by development of bipedalism. Development of the larynx and integration of respiratory control were central to vocalization, which when combined with gesture are intermediary to human language. These adaptations were accompanied by progressive encephalization, with development of Theory of Mind to facilitate socialization. The varied clinical phenotypes of ALS can thus be understood in the context of inter-related functional complexes that subserve Tools and Talk; they have a long evolutionary history and are related to specific developmental neural and gene networks.

22445437;wos641;Environmental constraints shaping constituent order in emerging communication systems: Structural iconicity, interactive alignment and conventionalization;"Christensen P; Fusaroli R; Tylen K";Journal Article;Where does linguistic structure come from? Recent gesture elicitation studies have indicated that constituent-order (corresponding to for instance subject-verb-object, or SVO in English) may be heavily influenced by human cognitive biases constraining gesture production and transmission. Here we explore the alternative hypothesis that syntactic patterns are motivated by multiple environmental and social-interactional constraints that are external to the cognitive domain. In three experiments, we systematically investigate different motivations for structure in the gestural communication of simple transitive events. The first experiment indicates that, if participants communicate about different types of events, manipulation events (e.g. someone throwing a cake) and construction events (e.g. someone baking a cake), they spontaneously and systematically produce different constituent orders, SOV and SVO respectively, thus following the principle of structural iconicity. The second experiment shows that participants' choice of constituent order is also reliably influenced by social-interactional forces of interactive alignment, that is, the tendency to re-use an interlocutor's previous choice of constituent order, thus potentially overriding affordances for iconicity. Lastly, the third experiment finds that the relative frequency distribution of referent event types motivates the stabilization and conventionalization of a single constituent order for the communication of different types of events. Together, our results demonstrate that constituent order in emerging gestural communication systems is shaped and stabilized in response to multiple external environmental and social factors: structural iconicity, interactive alignment and distributional frequency.

To further explore this question, we examined the influence of different prior training histories/methods on the ability of horses (Equus ferus caballus) to follow a momentary distal point. Ten horses previously trained using one of two methods (Parelli T natural horsemanship or traditional horse training) were tested using a standard object choice task. The results show that neither group of horses was initially able to follow the momentary distal point. However, after more experience with the point, horses previously trained using the Parelli natural horsemanship method learned to follow momentary distal points significantly faster than those previously trained with traditional methods. The poor initial performance of horses on distal pointing tasks, coupled with the finding that prior training history and experimental experience can lead to success on this task, fails to support the predictions of the domestication hypothesis and instead lends support to the two-stage hypothesis.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445614;wos643;The multimodal construction of race: a review of critical race theory research;"Mills K A; Unsworth L";Journal Article;Issues of race periodically rupture in the national and international consciousness, while at other times, there is a false belief that society has arrived at a post-racial era. Either way, there remains impetus for the critical interrogation of the racialisation of multimodal literacies in education, and critical race theory (CRT) is a leading approach. This article reviews original studies that collectively analyse multimodal texts and practices to understand the construction of race in education. Multimodal texts have proliferated in online textual ecologies due to the ease of production and rapid global dissemination of image-based texts in the twenty-first century. Such texts combine two or more modes, such as images, words, sounds, and gestures. Sites for the circulation of multimodal literacies-online and offline-serve to disrupt, reify, or perhaps even exacerbate racial identities, prejudice, and subordination in education. The review highlights the prevalent themes: (a) Discursive construction of race in the spoken mode, (b) Anti-racist and multimodal counter-narratives, (c) The racialisation of multimodal literature for children and adolescents, and (d) Race in music, visual and performing arts, and digital media.

22444914;wos644;Strategies of reporting verbs' interpretation in modern russian translations of fiction;Urzha AV;Journal Article;The research presented in the article focuses on the phenomenon of substituting reporting verbs that introduce direct speech (e.g. say) by words with emotive and evaluation meanings in Russian translations of fiction. The paper systematizes and describes grammatical, semantic and stylistic aspects of this phenomenon revealed in typology, studies of the Russian language, stylistics and translation studies up to nowadays. Two opposing views on the issue existing in Russian and European translation critics are presented in the paper: on the one hand, substitution of repeated reporting verbs by emotive ones helps to avoid tautology and monotonousness of the dialog frame, on the other hand, it interferes and distorts the semantics of the original. From the widespread linguocultural attitude, interpreting this issue as a domestication feature in translation, the author offers to shift to functional attitude, focusing on pragmatic effects of such substitutions. The material of the research is represented with the corpus of modern Russian translations of narratives for children. The results of the comparative analysis of texts and statistic data confirm that the substitution of reporting verbs by emotive words and nominations of gestures is regularly found in both domesticating and foreignizing translations, being connected mostly to the specific features of the target children audience and high emotiveness of the fragments where reporting verbs occur. These results enable us to adjust current estimations of the phenomenon in question in the translation assessment, adding functional view on its context and pragmatic effects.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445750;wos645;Referential gestures in fish collaborative hunting;"Vail A L; Manica A; Bshary R";Journal Article;In humans, referential gestures intentionally draw the attention of a partner to an object of mutual interest, and are considered a key element in language development. Outside humans, referential gestures have only been attributed to great apes and, most recently, ravens. This was interpreted as further evidence for the comparable cognitive abilities of primates and corvids. Here we describe a signal that coral reef fishes, the grouper Plectropomus pessuliferus marisrubri and coral trout Plectropomus leopardus, use to indicate hidden prey to cooperative hunting partners, including giant moray eels Gymnothorax javanicus, Napoleon wrasses Chelinus undulatus and octopuses Octopus cyanea. We provide evidence that the signal possesses the five attributes proposed to infer a referential gesture: it is directed towards an object, mechanically ineffective, directed towards a potential recipient, receives a voluntary response and demonstrates hallmarks of intentionality. Thus, referential gesture use is not restricted to large-brained vertebrates.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The need for reliable empirical data on users' preferences, behaviours and strategies (with respect to this new form of multimodality) is crucial for the definition of adequate user models that could significantly contribute to the efficiency and usability of future multimodal user interfaces. We describe a prospective ergonomic study which aims to provide empirical data on how users will use unconstrained speech and gestures for interacting with standard computer applications. Despite recent scientific advances in natural language interpretation, continuous speech recognition and gesture analysis, operational interaction systems capable of interpreting complex multimodal utterances accurately are not yet available. Therefore, in order to study the forms of multimodal expression that users will develop spontaneously while interacting with software systems capable of a ''understanding'' speech and a-dimensional gestures (on the screen), we have designed a realistic simulation of such an interaction system, using the Wizard of Oz experimental paradigm. Eight subjects performed various design tasks, using this simulated user interface during three weekly sessions. Analyses of the audio-visual protocols suggest great inter-individual differences, as regards subjects' styles of expression and their strategies for combining speech with gestures. Styles of expression can be divided into two broad classes according to the nature of the relationships between the subjects and the system : communication with a machine interlocutor or manipulation of a graphical representation of the application. After a short initial adaptation phase, which is confined to the first scenario or to the first session, the styles of most subjects do nor evolve. We observed a few instances of later evolution which point to inter-individual differences relating to the capability of transferring competences acquired in the context of human communication to a human-computer interaction environment. Knowledge and skill transfers between human communication and human-computer interaction have not yet been studied extensively; they would motivate specific experimental or empirical studies, the results of which could improve significantly user models, and may prove of great interest to user interface designers.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445300;wos648;The effect of phonetic context on the dynamics of intrusions and reductions;"Van Lieshout PHHM; Slis AW";Journal Article;Recent studies have described speech errors as articulatory movements intruding during target constrictions as well as reduced movements of these target constrictions. These errors were hypothesized to originate from self organizing mechanisms underlying context-free gestural coordination. The current study investigates whether such self-organizing mechanisms and resulting speech errors are influenced by coproduction constraints, which are introduced by phonetic context. Speakers repeated CVC CVC word pairs, differing in onsets and sharing their rhymes. 'Phonetic context' was manipulated by changing the rhyme across different word pairs using specific vowel- and consonant-combinations. Vertical movements of tongue tip, tongue dorsum, and lower lip were recorded with Electro-Magnetic Articulography. The results revealed that the tongue dorsum as an intruding articulator showed more intrusions in front vowel context than in low back vowel context. In addition, this articulator showed more intrusions than the tongue tip in /ae/ context, and more intrusions than the lower lip in /I/ context. Reductions did not demonstrate this effect of vowel context. However, both tongue dorsum and tongue tip reduced more than the lower lip. The findings are explained in terms of the amount of spatial overlap of gestures and intruding articulatory movements, as defined in Articulatory Phonology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

All typical language dominant volunteers also revealed left hemisphere changes during tool use pantomiming in prefrontal, premotor, and posterior parietal regions. All atypical language dominant participants displayed right hemisphere engagement for tool use. Co-lateralization of the language and praxis networks was observed on group and individual level, regardless of the participant's handedness. Activation maps of the word generation and tool use pantomiming contrasts displayed overlap in five cortical regions: supplementary motor area, dorsal and ventral premotor cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and posterior parietal cortex. Individual lateralization indices were calculated for each region and revealed significant positive group correlations between .51 and .95 with every other region within the paradigms. Positive cross-task correlations ranged between .72 (supplementary motor complex) and .97 (dorsal premotor cortex) and illustrate that the strength of hemispheric specialization of one task significantly predicts the side and degree of lateralization of the other task, suggesting a functional and topographic link between language and praxis. These findings support models that link gestures and speech to explain the evolution of human language. We argue that the existence of a common and co-lateralized network underlying the production of complex learned movement, whether it be speech or tool use, may represent the evolutionary remnant of a neural system out of which proto-sign and proto-speech co-evolved.

22445708;wos650;Language cannot be reduced to biology: Perspectives from neuro-developmental disorders affecting language learning;Vasanta D;Journal Article;"The study of language knowledge guided by a purely biological perspective prioritizes the study of syntax. The essential process of syntax is recursion - the ability to generate an infinite array of expressions from a limited set of elements. Researchers working within the biological perspective argue that this ability is possible only because of an innately specified genetic makeup that is specific to human beings. Such a view of language knowledge may be fully justified in discussions on biolinguistics, and in evolutionary biology. However, it is grossly inadequate in understanding language-learning problems, particularly those experienced by children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as developmental dyslexia, Williams syndrome, specific language impairment and autism spectrum disorders. Specifically, syntax-centered definitions of language knowledge completely ignore certain crucial aspects of language learning and use, namely, that language is embedded in a social context; that the role of environmental triggering as a learning mechanism is grossly underestimated; that a considerable extent of visuo-spatial information accompanies speech in day-to-day communication; that the developmental process itself lies at the heart of knowledge acquisition; and that there is a tremendous variation in the orthographic systems associated with different languages. All these (socio-cultural) factors can influence the rate and quality of spoken and written language acquisition resulting in much variation in phenotypes associated with disorders known to have a genetic component. Delineation of such phenotypic variability requires inputs from varied disciplines such as neurobiology, neuropsychology, linguistics and communication disorders. In this paper, I discuss published research that questions cognitive modularity and emphasises the role of the environment for understanding linguistic capabilities of children with neuro-developmental disorders.

Results revealed that the vast majority of pointing gestures were right-handed and accompanied by vocalizations, emphasizing the tight interconnection between speech and gesture from an early stage of development. Whole-hand gestures were more frequently used in imperative contexts, whereas index extensions were more frequently produced in declarative ones. Moreover, the use of declarative gestures and index extensions were found to increase with age.

If the roots of language are indeed in gestural communication, we expect that human infants and baboons will present a comparable difference in their pattern of laterality according to task: both should be more right-hand/left-hemisphere specialized when communicating by pointing than when simply grasping objects. Our study is the first to test both human infants and baboons on the same communicative task. Our results show remarkable convergence in the distribution of the two species' hand biases on the two kinds of tasks: In both human infants and baboons, right-hand preference was significantly stronger for the communicative task than for grasping objects.

22445162;wos655;What novice knappers have to learn to become expert stone toolmakers;"Geribas N; Mosquera M; Verges J M";Journal Article;The aim of this paper was to determine what technical gestures must be learned in order to produce stone tools. To identify these gestures, we compared the performance of expert knappers and complete novices. We hypothesised that the differences between novices and experts would indicate which technical gestures experts had learned to successfully produce stone tools. Participants were video recorded while attempting to produce a crude handaxe. The recordings were analysed according to ethological methods used to study animal and human behaviour. The knapping performance of each participant was segmented and scored into units in order to identify the technical gestures being used. The results showed considerable differences between experts and novices in three technical gestures: the type of percussion support, the position of the blank and the angle of blow. Therefore, these three technical gestures appear to be crucial in learning to knap stone at the level of bifacial stone toolmakers. By studying how modern knappers gradually master these three technical gestures we may begin to understand how stone knapping is acquired, how bifacial stone tools emerged and what cognitive challenges early handaxe makers had to face.

To measure how gestures may change over time as a result of the process of conventionalization, we used a social coordination game to elicit repeated silent gestures from hearing non-signers, and used Microsoft Kinect to unobtrusively track the movement of their bodies as they gestured. Our approach follows from a tradition of laboratory experiments designed to study language evolution and draws upon insights from sign language research on language emergence. Working with silent gesture, we were able to simulate and quantify hallmarks of conventionalization that have been described for sign languages, in the laboratory. With Kinect, we measured a reduction in the size of the articulatory space and a decrease in the distance traveled by the articulators, while communicative success increased between participants over time. This approach opens the door for more direct future comparisons between ad hoc gestures produced in the lab and natural sign languages in the world.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Rather, the arbitrary and symbolic nature of language has long been taken as a design feature of the human linguistic system. In this paper, we propose an alternative framework in which iconicity in face-to-face communication (spoken and signed) is a powerful vehicle for bridging between language and human sensori-motor experience, and, as such, iconicity provides a key to understanding language evolution, development and processing. In language evolution, iconicity might have played a key role in establishing displacement (the ability of language to refer beyond what is immediately present), which is core to what language does; in ontogenesis, iconicity might play a critical role in supporting referentiality (learning to map linguistic labels to objects, events, etc., in the world), which is core to vocabulary development. Finally, in language processing, iconicity could provide a mechanism to account for how language comes to be embodied (grounded in our sensory and motor systems), which is core to meaningful communication.";Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444890;wos659;Human corporeality and techniques of writing in Andre Leroi-Gourhan' s anthropology;Viktor L K;Journal Article;"A new paradigm in the social sciences, often called 'material turn', appeared at the end of the twentieth century. As is known, typical of modernity was the understanding of human beings as the only active subjects; however, it can be argued that the world of artifacts also has an active part to play as artifacts are not just signs of social relations. Today, there are many texts devoted to rethinking of these ideas that reveal the place of man in the world in a new way. Man appears in history not as a thought, not only as an ideal consciousness, but as an embodied physical being. Physicality is no longer considered only as a natural component of social interactions. This does not mean that a human being ceases to be a physiological being. The body is the way by which Nature becomes Human Being. The study of such transformation requires an interdisciplinary methodology. And now historians, anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists simply cannot ignore the results obtained in the course of this turn. This article explores the ideas of A. Leroi-Gourhan which we find in his fundamental work titled 'Gesture and Speech' (1964). Many ideas of his preceded those at the core of the `material turn'. He developed an original methodology which allowed to put forward a number of theoretical provisions concerning the evolution as a whole and revealing the relationship of human evolution and technology, and the connection between the brain and language, as well as to identify the stages of social organism formation, to trace the birth of figurative graphics and verbal symbolism leading to the invention of art. Man is not a monopolist in the world of technology; technology is not limited to being an extension of the physical person, it is rooted in people's movements and gestures. Gesture is understood not as a kind of language, but as a part of any language, as a basis for writing. Gestures give rise to related types of writing - when the visible language of images correlates with the audible language of speech.

23080891;wos660;Explaining Dog Wolf Differences in Utilizing Human Pointing Gestures: Selection for Synergistic Shifts in the Development of Some Social Skills;"Gácsi M; Gyoöri B; Virányi Z; Kubinyi E; Range F; Belényi B; Miklósi Á";Journal Article;"Background: The comparison of human related communication skills of socialized canids may help to understand the evolution and the epigenesis of gesture comprehension in humans. To reconcile previously contradicting views on the origin of dogs' outstanding performance in utilizing human gestures, we suggest that dog-wolf differences should be studied in a more complex way.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We present data both on the performance and the behaviour of dogs and wolves of different ages in a two-way object choice test. Characteristic behavioural differences showed that for wolves it took longer to establish eye contact with the pointing experimenter, they struggled more with the handler, and pups also bit her more before focusing on the human's signal. The performance of similarly hand-reared 8-week-old dogs and wolves did not differ in utilizing the simpler proximal momentary pointing. However, when tested with the distal momentary pointing, 4-month-old pet dogs outperformed the same aged hand reared wolves. Thus early and intensive socialisation does not diminish differences between young dogs and wolves in behaviour and performance. Socialised adult wolves performed similarly well as dogs in this task without pretraining. The success of adult wolves was accompanied with increased willingness to cooperate.
Conclusion/Significance: Thus, we provide evidence for the first time that socialised adult wolves are as successful in relying on distal momentary pointing as adult pet dogs. However, the delayed emergence of utilising human distal momentary pointing in wolves shows that these wild canines react to a lesser degree to intensive socialisation in contrast to dogs, which are able to control agonistic behaviours and inhibition of actions in a food related task early in development. We suggest a 'synergistic'' hypothesis, claiming that positive feedback processes (both evolutionary and epigenetic) have increased the readiness of dogs to attend to humans, providing the basis for dog-human communication.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445230;wos661;Wolves Are Better Imitators of Conspecifics than Dogs;"Range F; Viranyi Z;";Journal Article;Domestication is thought to have influenced the cognitive abilities of dogs underlying their communication with humans, but little is known about its effect on their interactions with conspecifics. Since domestication hypotheses offer limited predictions in regard to wolf-wolf compared to dog-dog interactions, we extend the cooperative breeding hypothesis suggesting that the dependency of wolves on close cooperation with conspecifics, including breeding but also territory defense and hunting, has created selection pressures on motivational and cognitive processes enhancing their propensity to pay close attention to conspecifics' actions. During domestication, dogs' dependency on conspecifics has been relaxed, leading to reduced motivational and cognitive abilities to interact with conspecifics. Here we show that 6-month-old wolves outperform same aged dogs in a two-action-imitation task following a conspecific demonstration. While the wolves readily opened the apparatus after a demonstration, the dogs failed to solve the problem. This difference could not be explained by differential motivation, better physical insight of wolves, differential developmental pathways of wolves and dogs or a higher dependency of dogs from humans. Our results are best explained by the hypothesis that higher cooperativeness may come together with a higher propensity to pay close attention to detailed actions of others and offer an alternative perspective to domestication by emphasizing the cooperativeness of wolves as a potential source of dog-human cooperation.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444997;wos662;Wolves (Canis lupus) and Dogs (Canis familiaris) Differ in Following Human Gaze Into Distant Space But Respond Similar to Their Packmates' Gaze;"Werhahn G; Viranyi Z; Barrera G; Sommese A; Range F";Journal Article;Gaze following into distant space is defined as visual co-orientation with another individual's head direction allowing the gaze follower to gain information on its environment. Human and nonhuman animals share this basic gaze following behavior, suggested to rely on a simple reflexive mechanism and believed to be an important prerequisite for complex forms of social cognition. Pet dogs differ from other species in that they follow only communicative human gaze clearly addressed to them. However, in an earlier experiment we showed that wolves follow human gaze into distant space. Here we set out to investigate whether domestication has affected gaze following in dogs by comparing pack-living dogs and wolves raised and kept under the same conditions. In Study 1 we found that in contrast to the wolves, these dogs did not follow minimally communicative human gaze into distant space in the same test paradigm. In the observational Study 2 we found that pack-living dogs and wolves, similarly vigilant to environmental stimuli, follow the spontaneous gaze of their conspecifics similarly often. Our findings suggest that domestication did not affect the gaze following ability of dogs itself. The results raise hypotheses about which other dog skills might have been altered through domestication that may have influenced their performance in Study 1. Because following human gaze in dogs might be influenced by special evolutionary as well as developmental adaptations to interactions with humans, we suggest that comparing dogs to other animal species might be more informative when done in intraspecific social contexts.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These questions, although quite emblematic of the Western intellectual tradition since its ancient beginnings, so far have not found satisfying answers. Indeed, many still question the very possibility of addressing these basic problems of the origins of language with proper scientific rigor (see e.g. Hauser et al. 2014). However, an emerging consensus is that current research in the field of language evolution is in fact bearing fruit, making it at least possible to judge in an informed manner which of these competing scenarios are far more or less probable.

We arrive at a definition of pantomime as a communication mode that is mimetic; non-conventional and motivated; multimodal (primarily visual); improvised; using the whole body rather than exclusively manual; holistic; communicatively complex and self-sufficient; semantically complex; displaced, open-ended and universal. So conceived, 'pantomime' is a near synonym of 'bodily-mimetic communication' as envisaged by Donald and Zlatev.

23080875;wos667;A Human-Centered Approach to One-Shot Gesture Learning;"Cabrera M E; Wachs JP";Journal Article;This article discusses the problem of one-shot gesture recognition using a human centered approach and its potential application to fields such as human robot interaction where the user's intentions are indicated through spontaneous gesturing (one shot). Casual users have limited time to learn the gestures interface, which makes one-shot recognition an attractive alternative to interface customization. In the aim of natural interaction with machines, a framework must be developed to include the ability of humans to understand gestures from a single observation. Previous approaches to one-shot gesture recognition have relied heavily on statistical and data-mining-based solutions and have ignored the mechanisms that are used by humans to perceive and execute gestures and that can provide valuable context information. This omission has led to suboptimal solutions. The focus of this study is on the process that leads to the realization of a gesture, rather than on the gesture itself. In this case, context involves the way in which humans produce gestures the kinematic and anthropometric characteristics. In the method presented here, the strategy is to generate a data set of realistic samples based on features extracted from a single gesture sample. These features, called the 'gist of a gesture,' are considered to represent what humans remember when seeing a gesture and, later, the cognitive process involved when trying to replicate it. By adding meaningful variability to these features, a large training data set is created while preserving the fundamental structure of the original gesture. The availability of a large data set of realistic samples allows the use of training classifiers for future recognition. The performance of the method is evaluated using different lexicons, and its efficiency is compared with that of traditional N-shot learning approaches. The strength of the approach is further illustrated through human and machine recognition of gestures performed by a dual-arm robotic platform.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Recognition of human gestures is important for analysis and indexing of video. To recognize human gestures on video, generally a large number of training examples for each individual gesture must be collected. This is a labor-intensive and error-prone process and is only feasible for a limited set of gestures. In this paper, we present an approach for automatically segmenting sequences of natural activities into atomic sections and clustering them. Our work is inspired by natural language processing where words are extracted from long sentences. We extract primitive gestures from sequences of human motion. Our approach contains two steps. First, the sequences of human motion are segmented into atomic components and clustered using a Hidden Markov Model. Thus we can represent the original sequences by discrete symbols. Then we extract lexicon from these discrete sequences by using an algorithm named COMPRESSIVE.

23080812;wos669;Production of grooming-associated sounds by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at Ngogo: variation, social learning, and possible functions;Watts D P;Journal Article;"Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) use some communicative signals flexibly and voluntarily, with use influenced by learning. These signals include some vocalizations and also sounds made using the lips, oral cavity, and/or teeth, but not the vocal tract, such as 'attention-getting' sounds directed at humans by captive chimpanzees and lip smacking during social grooming. Chimpanzees at Ngogo, in Kibale National Park, Uganda, make four distinct sounds while grooming others. Here, I present data on two of these ('splutters' and 'teeth chomps') and consider whether social learning contributes to variation in their production and whether they serve social functions. Higher congruence in the use of these two sounds between dyads of maternal relatives than dyads of non-relatives implies that social learning occurs and mostly involves vertical transmission, but the results are not conclusive and it is unclear which learning mechanisms may be involved. In grooming between adult males, tooth chomps and splutters were more likely in long than in short bouts; in bouts that were bidirectional rather than unidirectional; in grooming directed toward high-ranking males than toward low-ranking males; and in bouts between allies than in those between non-allies. Males were also more likely to make these sounds while they were grooming other males than while they were grooming females. These results are expected if the sounds promote social bonds and induce tolerance of proximity and of grooming by high-ranking males. However, the alternative hypothesis that the sounds are merely associated with motivation to groom, with no additional social function, cannot be ruled out. Limited data showing that bouts accompanied by teeth chomping or spluttering at their initiation were longer than bouts for which this was not the case point toward a social function, but more data are needed for a definitive test.

Co-speech gestures frequently add information about pain that is not contained in the accompanying speech. We explored whether recipients can obtain additional information from gestures about the pain that is being described.
Methods: Participants (n = 135) viewed clips of pain descriptions under one of four conditions: 1) Speech Only; 2) Speech and Gesture; 3) Speech, Gesture and Face; and 4) Speech, Gesture and Face plus Instruction (short presentation explaining the pain information that gestures can depict). Participants provided free-text descriptions of the pain that had been described. Responses were scored for the amount of information obtained from the original clips.
Findings: Participants in the Instruction condition obtained the most information, while those in the Speech Only condition obtained the least (all comparisons p < 0.001).
Conclusions: Gestures produced during pain descriptions provide additional information about pain that recipients are able to pick up without detriment to their uptake of spoken information.
Practice implications: Healthcare professionals may benefit from instruction in gestures to enhance uptake of information about patients' pain experiences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

22445627;wos671;Laterality of hand function in naturalistically housed chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes);"Fletcher A W; Weghorst J A";Journal Article;Studies of laterality of hand function in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have the potential to tell us about the origins of handedness in Homo sapiens. However, the data are confusing, with discrepancies present between studies done in the field and the laboratory: the former show wild chimpanzees to be unlateralised at the population level, while the latter show captive chimpanzees as lateralised at the population level. This study of 26 semi-free ranging chimpanzees of Chester Zoo, UK, aimed to investigate a situation between the wild and captivity and provided ethological data for 43 categories of spontaneous manual use and 14 categories of tool use. Other variables recorded were subordinate hand activity, whether the subject was arboreal or terrestrial, and the identity of the subject. Using switching focal subject sampling, 23,978 bouts of hand use and 1,090 bouts of tool use were recorded. No population-level handedness was present for manual non-tool use activities in the naturalistically housed chimpanzees of Chester Zoo in a similar way to studies of wild chimpanzees. However, about half of the individuals were lateralised to one side or the other for the foraging behaviours of pick up, eat, and pluck. Using a modified version of McGrew and Marchant's (1997) Laterality Framework, these results are comparable to some wild and captive populations for similar foraging tasks. Bimanuality was rare and thus prevented comparison with captive experimental studies that have reported population right handedness. Behaviour involving contact with water elicited stronger lateralisation. Chester chimpanzees were more likely to exhibit hand preferences for manual tasks with increasing age but there were no effects of sex or rearing history on hand specialisations in adult individuals. Lateralisation was biased in tool use, which evoked significant left hand preferences in half the individuals, with no effect of age. Results are discussed comparatively with reference to methodological and developmental issues.

Until now, most notation systems rely on a complex plethora of symbols and are under-specific, to the extent that visual images are still the most widely accepted way of recording primary data. This paper presents a novel phonetic notation of handshape in a step towards deriving an International Phonetic Alphabet for sign languages, based on digit shape (configuration) and position in terms of reference coordinates, aiming at both readability and precision. It is sufficiently hybrid to allow for both accurate measurements and estimates of digit positions, thereby affording a way of representing handshapes suitable for lexicography, studying phonetic variation and avatar programming. Originally tailored to describe handshapes in South African Sign Language, it can also notate gestures. After discussing transcription methods and hand physiology, digit configurations are defined in terms of joint angles. Variations in configuration positions are then specified in terms of Cartesian reference coordinates.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444827;wos673;Covert word reading induces a late response in the hand motor system of the language dominant hemisphere;"Meister I G; Weier K; Staedtgen M; Buelte D; Thirugnanasambandam N";Journal Article;Recent work has demonstrated that overt reading influences the excitability of the language-dominant hand motor cortex. However, this effect was related to speech output, whereas results on silent reading have been inconsistent, and have not allowed for systematic investigation of the different stages of word recognition. To investigate a possible modulation of the cortical excitability mediating hand movements through different stages of covert reading, motor evoked potentials (MEP) from hand muscles in right-handed subjects were recorded. We showed a significant increase of the excitability of the hand motor cortex of the dominant hemisphere during late stages of covert word reading, whereas processing of abstract shapes had no effect and covert articulation induced a decrease in hand motor cortex excitability. There was no significant change of MEP amplitudes during earlier stages of covert reading in the dominant hemisphere or in the non-dominant hemisphere. Our results demonstrate a functional connection between cortical networks mediating linguistic processing and hand movements without concurrent activation of the motor cortex through overt articulation at late stages of word reading, which have been shown to involve converging activation of classic left frontal language regions. We speculate that the effect reported here is related to a cortical network mediating gestures which are a part of verbal communication. This supports recent theories on language evolution which postulate that language emerged through manual gestures. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Results revealed significant population-level handedness for two of the three measuresthe tube task and manual gestures. Furthermore, significant additive genetic effects for the direction and strength of handedness were found for all three measures, with some modulation due to early social rearing experiences.

This proposal recognizes both visible and vocal gestures as having an evolutionary role but suggests that visible gestures played a special role in the emergence of syntax. The fundamental kernal of syntax is seen as inherent in visible gestural communication and available for extension by means of ordinary evolutionary processes. In manual gesturing, a hand (as agent) moves (what verbs imply) and may act on another part of the body (as patient). It is proposed, then, that the formation of a manual gesture entails a preadaptive elementary syntax. As gesture becomes linguistic sign, it carries with it the seed of the basic syntactic relationship-it refers and also relates. The social behavior of the hominids could have supplied conditions that enhanced the fitness of individuals and groups with increasingly sophisticated communication systems. The embryo sentences already present in gestural communication might then have constituted preadaptive behaviors available for extension into increasingly complex syntactic structures.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These features include sharing common articulators with gestures, and exhibiting substantial iconicity in comparison to spoken languages. If human proto-language was gestural, the question remains of how a highly iconic manual communication system might have been transformed into a primarily vocal communication system in which the links between symbol and referent are for the most part arbitrary. The hypothesis presented here focuses on a class of signs which exhibit: 'echo phonology,' a repertoire of mouth actions which are characterized by 'echoing' on the mouth certain of the articulatory actions of the hands. The basic features of echo phonology are introduced, and discussed in relation to various types of data. Echo phonology provides naturalistic examples of a possible mechanism accounting for part of the evolution of language, with evidence both of the transfer of manual actions to oral ones and the conversion of units of an iconic manual communication system into a largely arbitrary vocal communication system.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Gu's very gesture of crossing the divide between the Chinese language and the English language reminds us that the idea of a monolingual and homogeneous culture is never adequate for characterizing human activities. Nevertheless, his notion of cultural boundary is limited by categories such as 'nations' and 'civilizations', and thus, it stops short of disclosing other contact zones of cultures. In contrast, Segalen brings the Chinese language and the French language into an equivocal relationship of 'origin' and 'translation' as well as exploring a non-identitarian interweaving of cultures. This essay argues that while China's rapid incorporation into the global economic system seems to portend that the global status quo will bind us in an enclosed space of ever more sameness, be it capitalist economy, information technology or mass-culture industry, Segalen inspires us to put into play a world in which relations remain to be made and for which differences have yet to be articulated through the enactments of spaces he demonstrates in Steles.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

22445636;wos687;Indirect reports as semantic-pragmatic games;Yasrebi S;Journal Article;This paper examines indirect reports from the lens of socio-cognitive approach (SCA) to pragmatics. Indirect reports have the capacity to re-mold the substance of the original utterance as a whole. In direct reporting, the original utterance is produced in an actual situational context, and then, it is being reported by a different speaker in a new situational context. So, the utterance which was initially produced is only interpretable in the light of the common ground A whereas the reported utterance is only interpretable in the light of common ground B. We have it from Kecskes (2013. Intercultural pragmatics. New York: Oxford University Press: 159) that 'common ground is both an a priori existing and a cooperatively constructed mental abstraction. Likewise, the main condition of reporting is the need of the hearer: there would be no need for reported speech if the audience were already aware of the content of the report. For that reason, the process of meaning making in reporting, that is, the transmission and simultaneously creation of meaning is inextricably bound with the question of context, salience, common ground, pragmatics, semantics and syntax, not to mention all those bodily gestures and expressions that can, or more importantly, cannot be registered in language.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Touching with the tip of the trunk is a common social behaviour among Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). This is considered an affiliative behaviour; however, few studies have investigated it in detail. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether this is an affiliative behaviour and whether it has other functions. We directly observed a group of captive female Asian elephants in Thailand. We found that the elephants usually touched each other with their trunks shaped in a U (U-type) or S (S-type) shape. The S-type shape was observed mainly when the elephants touched the lips of other elephants; however, this behaviour was occasionally observed in agonistic or play contexts, where it appeared to be a threat or dominant behaviour, particularly amongst adults. In contrast, the U-type shape was more frequently observed when the elephants were disturbed, where it appeared as a gesture for reassurance. We found that the U-type touch on the genitals may be used for interacting with neonates. Therefore, we suggest that despite the S-type touch having a tactile component, it may be a rare behaviour in Asian elephants that is similar to visual threat displays in other mammals. However, the U-type touch is similar to social grooming behaviour in primates or flipper rubbing in dolphins, and can be used as an indicator of affiliative relationships. Asian elephants change the shape of their trunk while touching others depending on their motivation and the situation, thereby demonstrating that the nuances of trunk use can assist in understanding the social relationships between individuals.";Excluded;NA;Not focused on primates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This article aims at providing an overview of the current situation of film translation in China and explores the two major types of English-Chinese film translation: dubbing and subtitling. Therefore, it can be roughly divided into two parts. The first part constitutes a general background for the study of film translation. The author of this article first discusses film's origin and nature, the features of film language and the classification of film translation. Of the four categories of film translation (subtitling, lip-sync dubbing, narration, and free-commentary), dubbing and subtitling are the main forms used in China. Then the differences between the two types and social preference for them are analyzed. The author also presents a summary of film translation's development and current studies on this topic. The second part probes into the details of dubbing and subtitling. This article investigates the features and technical constraints of dubbing and subtitling. The main techniques adopted in practice are illustrated through specific examples. Both forms have their relative advantages and disadvantages. In subtitling, standardization and simplification are its two important techniques. Standardization is concerned with the transfer of text mode - from spoken text to written text, while simplification is related to the technical constraints in subtitling, namely spatial and temporal constraints. In dubbing, the translator should make his translation fit into the pictures and synchronize the lines and the pictures, so lip synchronization, gestures and pauses are the major constraints in dubbing. As the two main forms of film translation in China, dubbing and subtitling coexist and compete with each other in the market.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In our research, we use the facial expression and gestures to detect and recognize a user's emotion. The pervasive Microsoft Kinect sensor captures video data, from which several features representing facial expressions and gestures are extracted. An in-house extensible markup language-based genetic programming engine (XGP) evolves the emotion recognition module of our system. To improve the computational performance of the recognition module, we implemented and compared several approaches, including directed evolution, collaborative filtering via canonical voting, and a genetic algorithm, for an automated voting system. The experimental results indicate that XGP is feasible for evolving emotion classifiers. In addition, the obtained results verify that collaborative filtering improves the generality of recognition. From a psychological viewpoint, the results prove that different people might express their emotions differently, as the emotion classifiers that are evolved for particular users might not be applied successfully to other user(s).";Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445266;wos691;'We're all real serious filmmakers': Learning about and creating multimodal mini-documentaries;Zammit K;Journal Article;"Purpose This study aims to seek to demonstrate how explicit teaching of SFL metalinguistic and multimodal grammars enhanced 8-9-year-old children's deeper understanding and production of multimodal texts through critique of the construction of mini-documentaries about animals: the information, language of narration, composition of scenes and resources to engage the viewer. It also seeks to demonstrate how a knowledge of metalinguistic and multimodal grammars contributes to students achieving both content knowledge and understanding of the resources of semiotic modes.
Design/methodology/approach A design-based approach was used with the teacher and author working closely together to implement a unit of work on mini-documentaries, including explicit teaching of the metalanguage of information reports, mini-documentary narration (aka script) and multimodal resources deployed to scaffold students' creating their own mini-documentaries.
Findings The students' mini-documentaries demonstrate how knowledge of SFL written and multimodal SFL-informed grammars assisted students to learn how meaning was created through selection of resources from the written, visual, sound and gestural modes and apply this knowledge to creating multimodal texts demonstrating their understandings of the topic and how to make meaning in a multimodal mini-documentary.
Research limitations/implications The research is limited to the outcomes from one group of students in one class. Generalisation to other contexts is not possible. Further studies are required to support the results from this research.
Practical implications The linguistic and multimodal SFL-informed grammars can be applied by educators to critique multimodal texts in a range of mediums and scaffold students' production of multimodal texts. They can also inform assessment criteria and expand students' conception of what is literate practice.

The target object is located and segmented by gesture recognition and speech analysis and finally grasped through path teaching. To obtain the posture of the human gesture accurately, the authors use the Kalman filtering (KF) algorithm to calibrate the posture use the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for human motion modeling, and then use Gaussian mixed regression (GMR) to predict human motion posture.
Findings - In the point-cloud information, many of which are useless, the authors combined human's gesture to remove irrelevant objects in the environment as much as possible, which can help to reduce the computation while dividing and recognizing objects; at the same time to reduce the computation, the authors used the sampling algorithm based on the voxel grid.

22444952;wos694;Spatial Reference in a Bonobo Gesture;"Genty E; Zuberbuhler K";Journal Article;Great apes frequently produce gestures during social interactions to communicate in flexible, goal-directed ways [1-3], a feature with considerable relevance for the ongoing debate over the evolutionary origins of human language [1, 4]. But despite this shared feature with language, there has been a lack of evidence for semantic content in ape gestures. According to one authoritative view, ape gestures thus do not have any specific referential, iconic, or deictic content, a fundamental difference versus human gestures and spoken language [1, 5] that suggests these features have a more recent origin in human evolution, perhaps caused by a fundamental transition from ape-like individual intentionality to human-like shared intentionality [6]. Here, we revisit this human uniqueness claim with a study of a previously undescribed human-like beckoning gesture in bonobos that has potentially both deictic and iconic character. We analyzed beckoning in two groups of bonobos, kept under near natural environmental and social conditions at the Lola Ya Bonobo sanctuary near Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, in terms of its linguistic content and underlying communicative intention.;Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444993;wos695;Wild chimpanzees' use of single and combined vocal and gestural signals;"Hobaiter C; Byrne R W; Zuberbuhler K";Journal Article;"We describe the individual and combined use of vocalizations and gestures in wild chimpanzees. The rate of gesturing peaked in infancy and, with the exception of the alpha male, decreased again in older age groups, while vocal signals showed the opposite pattern. Although gesture-vocal combinations were relatively rare, they were consistently found in all age groups, especially during affiliative and agonistic interactions. Within behavioural contexts rank (excluding alpha-rank) had no effect on the rate of male chimpanzees' use of vocal or gestural signals and only a small effect on their use of combination signals. The alpha male was an outlier, however, both as a prolific user of gestures and recipient of high levels of vocal and gesture-vocal signals. Persistence in signal use varied with signal type: chimpanzees persisted in use of gestures and gesture-vocal combinations after failure, but where their vocal signals failed they tended to add gestural signals to produce gesture-vocal combinations. Overall, chimpanzees employed signals with a sensitivity to the public/private nature of information, by adjusting their use of signal types according to social context and by taking into account potential out-of-sight audiences. We discuss these findings in relation to the various socio-ecological challenges that chimpanzees are exposed to in their natural forest habitats and the current discussion of multimodal communication in great apes.



Significance statement



All animal communication combines different types of signals, including vocalizations, facial expressions, and gestures. However, the study of primate communication has typically focused on the use of signal types in isolation. As a result, we know little on how primates use the full repertoire of signals available to them. Here we present a systematic study on the individual and combined use of gestures and vocalizations in wild chimpanzees. We find that gesturing peaks in infancy and decreases in older age, while vocal signals show the opposite distribution, and patterns of persistence after failure suggest that gestural and vocal signals may encode different types of information. Overall, chimpanzees employed signals with a sensitivity to the public/private nature of information, by adjusting their use of signal types according to social context and by taking into account potential out-of-sight audiences.";Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445688;wos697;Functionally referential communication in a chimpanzee;"Slocombe K E; Zuberbuhler K";Journal Article;The evolutionary origins of the use of speech signals to refer to events or objects in the world have remained obscure. Although functionally referential calls have been described in some monkey species [1, 2], studies with our closest living relatives, the great apes, have not generated comparable findings. These negative results have been taken to suggest that ape vocalizations are not the product of their otherwise sophisticated mentality and that ape gestural communication is more informative for theories of language evolution [3, 4]. We tested whether chimpanzee rough grunts, which are produced during feeding contexts [5-8], functioned as referential signals. Individuals produced acoustically distinct types of 'rough grunts' when encountering different foods. In a naturalistic playback experiment, a focal subject was able to use the information conveyed by these calls produced by several group mates to guide his search for food, demonstrating that the different grunt types were meaningful to him. This study provides experimental evidence that our closest living relatives can produce and understand functionally referential calls as part of their natural communication. We suggest that these findings give support to the vocal rather than gestural theories of language evolution.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445093;wos698;Chimpanzee Alarm Call Production Meets Key Criteria for Intentionality;"Schel A M; Townsend S W; Machanda Z; Zuberbuhler K; Slocombe K E";Journal Article;Determining the intentionality of primate communication is critical to understanding the evolution of human language. Although intentional signalling has been claimed for some great ape gestural signals, comparable evidence is currently lacking for their vocal signals. We presented wild chimpanzees with a python model and found that two of three alarm call types exhibited characteristics previously used to argue for intentionality in gestural communication. These alarm calls were: (i) socially directed and given to the arrival of friends, (ii) associated with visual monitoring of the audience and gaze alternations, and (iii) goal directed, as calling only stopped when recipients were safe from the predator. Our results demonstrate that certain vocalisations of our closest living relatives qualify as intentional signals, in a directly comparable way to many great ape gestures. We conclude that our results undermine a central argument of gestural theories of language evolution and instead support a multimodal origin of human language.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444892;wos699;SEED Framework of Early Language Development: The Dynamic Coupling of Infant-Caregiver Perceiving and Acting Forms a Continuous Loop during Interaction;"Zukow-Goldring P; Rader N D";Journal Article;"The research and theory described here evolved from fine-grained descriptions of early word learning based on videotapes of infants and their families in the US and Mexico. This naturalistic approach led to theorizing about the perceptual processes underlying the caregiver's role in assisting infants' early word learning. Caregivers educate infants' attention by synchronizing the saying of a word with a dynamic gesture, a show, in which they display the object/referent to the infant. By making this perceptual information prominent, infants can detect an amodal invariant across gesture and speech. Doing so brackets the word and object within the auditory and visual flow of events and constitutes the basis for perceiving them as belonging together. Stemming from the earlier naturalistic work, we designed eye-tracking experiments to test three hypotheses: 1) infants will attend more to an object when the referring word is said if the speaker uses a dynamic, synchronized show gesture, rather than a static or asynchronous gesture; 2) a show gesture will be most effective in drawing attention away from the mouth to the object when the referring word is spoken; and 3) the use of a show gesture will lead to enhanced word learning. These experiments confirmed our hypotheses, establishing that infants detected referent-word relations best when the speaker used a show gesture. These results support the SEED Framework of early language development which delineates how the situated, culturally embodied, emergent, and distributed character of caregiver-infant interaction nurtures communicative behavior. The ability to communicate germinates and takes root during social interaction, as the dynamically-coupled perceiving-and-acting of infants and caregivers forms a continuous loop, each of them unceasingly affecting the other. These findings have implications for the design of cognitive systems in autonomous robots, especially 'tutor spotting' and detecting 'acoustic packages.'";Included;Included;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22444953;wos700;Vocal-auditory feedback and the modality transition problem in language evolution;"Orzechowski S; Wacewicz S; Zywiczynski P";Journal Article;The gestural theories, which see the origins of (proto)linguistic communication not in vocalization but rather in manual gesture, have come to take center stage in today's academic reflection on the roots of language. The gestural theories, however, suffer from a near-fatal problem of the so-called ''modality switch'', i.e. of how and why language could have transferred from the mostly-visual to the mostly-vocal form that it now has in human societies almost universally. In our paper, we offer a potential and partial solution to this problem. We take as our starting point a gestural scenario on which emerging language-like communication involves orofacial gestures, and we complement such a scenario with the inclusion of vocal-auditory feedback, which aids signal production. Such benefits of more articulatory precision that accrue to the signal producersmight have constituted one reason behind supplementing orofacial gestures with sound and so increasing the role of vocalization in the emerging (proto)language.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445118;wos701;A review of performance asymmetries in hand skill in nonhuman primates with a special emphasis on chimpanzees;Hopkins W D;Book Chapter;Most humans report preferring the right hand for a variety of manual actions. Additionally, most humans perform motor tasks better with their right hand, particularly among right-handed individuals, but less so among left-handed people. Some have suggested that asymmetries in performance rather than hand preference may better reflect left hemisphere specializations in motor functions. In contrast to humans, research on performance asymmetries in manual tasks by nonhuman primates has received far less empirical investigation. In this chapter, I review the evidence presented to date on individual-and population-level asymmetries in motor tasks in nonhuman primates. Broadly speaking, studies on motor asymmetries have focused on (1) intermanual differences in grasping morphology and (2) intermanual differences in performance on a variety of different motor tasks. The results suggest that some species show population-level left-right differences in motor skill. Moreover, performance differences between the left and right hands appear to be mediated by preferred hand use but not in a dissociative manner. The collective data suggest that measures of performance asymmetries in different primate species may provide additional insight into theories on the evolution of hemispheric specialization in motor control.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445572;wos702;Cognitive Foundations of Learning from Testimony;"Harris P L; Koenig M A; Corriveau K H; Jaswal V K";Book Chapter;Humans acquire much of their knowledge from the testimony of other people. An understanding of the way that information can be conveyed via gesture and vocalization is present in infancy. Thus, infants seek information from well-informed interlocutors, supply information to the ignorant, and make sense of communicative acts that they observe from a third-party perspective. This basic understanding is refined in the course of development. As they age, children's reasoning about testimony increasingly reflects an ability not just to detect imperfect or inaccurate claims but also to assess what inferences may or may not be drawn about informants given their particular situation. Children also attend to the broader characteristics of particular informants-their group membership, personality characteristics, and agreement or disagreement with other potential informants. When presented with unexpected or counterintuitive testimony, children are prone to set aside their own prior convictions, but they may sometimes defer to informants for inherently social reasons.;Excluded;NA;Not focused on gestures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22445060;wos704;Lateralization of the human brain;Corballis M C ;Book Chapter;It is often suggested that cerebral asymmetry, when a consistent direction of asymmetry prevails, is unique to humans. We now know that many other species exhibit directionally consistent cerebral and behavioral asymmetries. Nevertheless, the predominance of left-cerebral dominance for language and manual functions may have played a special role in human evolution, even though precursors may be found in other animals-and especially in the great apes. I argue that the common cerebral asymmetry for these functions derives from the origins of language in manual gestures. These, in turn, may originate in specialized circuits for grasping that have been identified in primates, and lateralization may have been progressively introduced as praxic and linguistic functions became more complex.;Excluded;NA;Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
